10.48550./arXiv.2503.11652,Bring Your Rear Cameras for Egocentric 3D Human Pose Estimation,"Hiroyasu Akada, Jian Wang, Vladislav Golyanik, Christian Theobalt","Egocentric 3D human pose estimation has been actively studied using cameras installed in front of a head-mounted device (HMD). While frontal placement is the optimal and the only option for some tasks, such as hand tracking, it remains unclear if the same holds for full-body tracking due to self-occlusion and limited field-of-view coverage. Notably, even the state-of-the-art methods often fail to estimate accurate 3D poses in many scenarios, such as when HMD users tilt their heads upward (a common motion in human activities). A key limitation of existing HMD designs is their neglect of the back of the body, despite its potential to provide crucial 3D reconstruction cues. Hence, this paper investigates the usefulness of rear cameras in the HMD design for full-body tracking. We also show that simply adding rear views to the frontal inputs is not optimal for existing methods due to their dependence on individual 2D joint detectors without effective multi-view integration. To address this issue, we propose a new transformer-based method that refines 2D joint heatmap estimation with multi-view information and heatmap uncertainty, thereby improving 3D pose tracking. Moreover, we introduce two new large-scale datasets, Ego4View-Syn and Ego4View-RW, for a rear-view evaluation. Our experiments show that the new camera configurations with back views provide superior support for 3D pose tracking compared to only frontal placements. The proposed method achieves significant improvement over the current state of the art (>10% on MPJPE). We will release the source code, trained models, and new datasets on our project page this https URL.",14/03/2025,Vision&Patrones
10.48550./arXiv.2503.11651,VGGT: Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer,"Jianyuan Wang, Minghao Chen, Nikita Karaev, Andrea Vedaldi, Christian Rupprecht, David Novotny","We present VGGT, a feed-forward neural network that directly infers all key 3D attributes of a scene, including camera parameters, point maps, depth maps, and 3D point tracks, from one, a few, or hundreds of its views. This approach is a step forward in 3D computer vision, where models have typically been constrained to and specialized for single tasks. It is also simple and efficient, reconstructing images in under one second, and still outperforming alternatives that require post-processing with visual geometry optimization techniques. The network achieves state-of-the-art results in multiple 3D tasks, including camera parameter estimation, multi-view depth estimation, dense point cloud reconstruction, and 3D point tracking. We also show that using pretrained VGGT as a feature backbone significantly enhances downstream tasks, such as non-rigid point tracking and feed-forward novel view synthesis.

However, altering camera trajectories of a given video remains under-explored, despite its importance in the field of video creation. It is non-trivial due to the extra constraints of maintaining multiple-frame appearance and dynamic synchronization. To address this, we present ReCamMaster, a camera-controlled generative video re-rendering framework that reproduces the dynamic scene of an input video at novel camera trajectories. The core innovation lies in harnessing the generative capabilities of pre-trained text-to-video models through a simple yet powerful video conditioning mechanism -- its capability often overlooked in current research. To overcome the scarcity of qualified training data, we construct a comprehensive multi-camera synchronized video dataset using Unreal Engine 5, which is carefully curated to follow real-world filming characteristics, covering diverse scenes and camera movements. It helps the model generalize to in-the-wild videos. Lastly, we further improve the robustness to diverse inputs through a meticulously designed training strategy. Extensive experiments tell that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines. Our method also finds promising applications in video stabilization, super-resolution, and outpainting. Project page: this https URL",14/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

In this paper, we introduce LayeredDepth, the first dataset with multi-layer depth annotations, including a real-world benchmark and a synthetic data generator, to support the task of multi-layer depth estimation. Our real-world benchmark consists of 1,500 images from diverse scenes, and evaluating state-of-the-art depth estimation methods on it reveals that they struggle with transparent objects. The synthetic data generator is fully procedural and capable of providing training data for this task with an unlimited variety of objects and scene compositions. Using this generator, we create a synthetic dataset with 15,300 images. Baseline models training solely on this synthetic dataset produce good cross-domain multi-layer depth estimation. Fine-tuning state-of-the-art single-layer depth models on it substantially improves their performance on transparent objects, with quadruplet accuracy on our benchmark increased from 55.14% to 75.20%.

10.48550./arXiv.2503.11609,Rethinking Few-Shot Adaptation of Vision-Language Models in Two Stages,"Matteo Farina, Massimiliano Mancini, Giovanni Iacca, Elisa Ricci","An old-school recipe for training a classifier is to (i) learn a good feature extractor and (ii) optimize a linear layer atop. When only a handful of samples are available per category, as in Few-Shot Adaptation (FSA), data are insufficient to fit a large number of parameters, rendering the above impractical. This is especially true with large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which motivated successful research at the intersection of Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) and FSA. In this work, we start by analyzing the learning dynamics of PEFT techniques when trained on few-shot data from only a subset of categories, referred to as the ``base'' classes. We show that such dynamics naturally splits into two distinct phases: (i) task-level feature extraction and (ii) specialization to the available concepts. To accommodate this dynamic, we then depart from prompt- or adapter-based methods and tackle FSA differently. Specifically, given a fixed computational budget, we split it to (i) learn a task-specific feature extractor via PEFT and (ii) train a linear classifier on top. We call this scheme Two-Stage Few-Shot Adaptation (2SFS). Differently from established methods, our scheme enables a novel form of selective inference at a category level, i.e., at test time, only novel categories are embedded by the adapted text encoder, while embeddings of base categories are available within the classifier. Results with fixed hyperparameters across two settings, three backbones, and eleven datasets, show that 2SFS matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art, while established methods degrade significantly across settings.",14/03/2025,Vision&Patrones
10.48550./arXiv.2503.11601,Advancing 3D Gaussian Splatting Editing with Complementary and Consensus Information,"Xuanqi Zhang, Jieun Lee, Chris Joslin, Wonsook Lee","We present a novel framework for enhancing the visual fidelity and consistency of text-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) editing. Existing editing approaches face two critical challenges: inconsistent geometric reconstructions across multiple viewpoints, particularly in challenging camera positions, and ineffective utilization of depth information during image manipulation, resulting in over-texture artifacts and degraded object boundaries. To address these limitations, we introduce: 1) A complementary information mutual learning network that enhances depth map estimation from 3DGS, enabling precise depth-conditioned 3D editing while preserving geometric structures. 2) A wavelet consensus attention mechanism that effectively aligns latent codes during the diffusion denoising process, ensuring multi-view consistency in the edited results. Through extensive experimentation, our method demonstrates superior performance in rendering quality and view consistency compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The results validate our framework as an effective solution for text-guided editing of 3D scenes.",14/03/2025,Vision&Patrones
10.48550./arXiv.2503.11579,Vamba: Understanding Hour-Long Videos with Hybrid Mamba-Transformers,"Weiming Ren, Wentao Ma, Huan Yang, Cong Wei, Ge Zhang, Wenhu Chen","State-of-the-art transformer-based large multimodal models (LMMs) struggle to handle hour-long video inputs due to the quadratic complexity of the causal self-attention operations, leading to high computational costs during training and inference. Existing token compression-based methods reduce the number of video tokens but often incur information loss and remain inefficient for extremely long sequences. In this paper, we explore an orthogonal direction to build a hybrid Mamba-Transformer model (VAMBA) that employs Mamba-2 blocks to encode video tokens with linear complexity. Without any token reduction, VAMBA can encode more than 1024 frames (640$\times$360) on a single GPU, while transformer-based models can only encode 256 frames. On long video input, VAMBA achieves at least 50% reduction in GPU memory usage during training and inference, and nearly doubles the speed per training step compared to transformer-based LMMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that VAMBA improves accuracy by 4.3% on the challenging hour-long video understanding benchmark LVBench over prior efficient video LMMs, and maintains strong performance on a broad spectrum of long and short video understanding tasks.",14/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Said Gurbuz, Michele Dolfi, Miquel Farré, Peter W. J. Staar","We introduce SmolDocling, an ultra-compact vision-language model targeting end-to-end document conversion. Our model comprehensively processes entire pages by generating DocTags, a new universal markup format that captures all page elements in their full context with location. Unlike existing approaches that rely on large foundational models, or ensemble solutions that rely on handcrafted pipelines of multiple specialized models, SmolDocling offers an end-to-end conversion for accurately capturing content, structure and spatial location of document elements in a 256M parameters vision-language model. SmolDocling exhibits robust performance in correctly reproducing document features such as code listings, tables, equations, charts, lists, and more across a diverse range of document types including business documents, academic papers, technical reports, patents, and forms -- significantly extending beyond the commonly observed focus on scientific papers. Additionally, we contribute novel publicly sourced datasets for charts, tables, equations, and code recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that SmolDocling competes with other Vision Language Models that are up to 27 times larger in size, while reducing computational requirements substantially. The model is currently available, datasets will be publicly available soon.",14/03/2025,Vision&Patrones
10.48550./arXiv.2503.11571,"RASA: Replace Anyone, Say Anything -- A Training-Free Framework for Audio-Driven and Universal Portrait Video Editing","Tianrui Pan, Lin Liu, Jie Liu, Xiaopeng Zhang, Jie Tang, Gangshan Wu, Qi Tian","Portrait video editing focuses on modifying specific attributes of portrait videos, guided by audio or video streams. Previous methods typically either concentrate on lip-region reenactment or require training specialized models to extract keypoints for motion transfer to a new identity. In this paper, we introduce a training-free universal portrait video editing framework that provides a versatile and adaptable editing strategy. This framework supports portrait appearance editing conditioned on the changed first reference frame, as well as lip editing conditioned on varied speech, or a combination of both. It is based on a Unified Animation Control (UAC) mechanism with source inversion latents to edit the entire portrait, including visual-driven shape control, audio-driven speaking control, and inter-frame temporal control. Furthermore, our method can be adapted to different scenarios by adjusting the initial reference frame, enabling detailed editing of portrait videos with specific head rotations and facial expressions. This comprehensive approach ensures a holistic and flexible solution for portrait video editing. The experimental results show that our model can achieve more accurate and synchronized lip movements for the lip editing task, as well as more flexible motion transfer for the appearance editing task.

As such, many approaches to enable this vision have been explored with fruitful results. Particularly, object-centric representation methods have been shown to provide better inductive biases for skill learning, leading to improved performance and generalization. Nonetheless, we show that object-centric methods can struggle to learn simple manipulation skills in multi-object environments. Thus, we propose DOCIR, an object-centric framework that introduces a disentangled representation for objects of interest, obstacles, and robot embodiment. We show that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance for learning pick and place skills from visual inputs in multi-object environments and generalizes at test time to changing objects of interest and distractors in the scene. Furthermore, we show its efficacy both in simulation and zero-shot transfer to the real world.",14/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Although recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across language and vision-language tasks, existing benchmarks primarily measure recognition-based skills and inadequately assess true visual reasoning capabilities. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce VERIFY, a benchmark explicitly designed to isolate and rigorously evaluate the visual reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs. VERIFY compels models to reason primarily from visual information, providing minimal textual context to reduce reliance on domain-specific knowledge and linguistic biases. Each problem is accompanied by a human-annotated reasoning path, making it the first to provide in-depth evaluation of model decision-making processes. Additionally, we propose novel metrics that assess visual reasoning fidelity beyond mere accuracy, highlighting critical imbalances in current model reasoning patterns. Our comprehensive benchmarking of leading MLLMs uncovers significant limitations, underscoring the need for a balanced and holistic approach to both perception and reasoning.

While token pruning offers a promising solution, existing methods often introduce training overhead or fail to adapt dynamically across layers. We present SAINT, a training-free token pruning framework that leverages token similarity and a graph-based formulation to dynamically optimize pruning rates and redundancy thresholds. Through systematic analysis, we identify a universal three-stage token evolution process (aligner-explorer-aggregator) in transformers, enabling aggressive pruning in early stages without sacrificing critical information. For ViTs, SAINT doubles the throughput of ViT-H/14 at 224px with only 0.6% accuracy loss on ImageNet-1K, surpassing the closest competitor by 0.8%. For VLMs, we apply SAINT in three modes: ViT-only, LLM-only, and hybrid. SAINT reduces LLaVA-13B's tokens by 75%, achieving latency comparable to LLaVA-7B with less than 1% performance loss across benchmarks.

Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution; however, most current methods rely on external datasets or pre-trained models, which add complexity and escalate resource demands. In this work, we introduce a novel self-contained synthetic augmentation technique that strategically samples from a conditional generative model trained exclusively on the target dataset. This approach eliminates the need for auxiliary data sources. Applied to face recognition datasets, our method achieves 1--12\% performance improvements on the IJB-C and IJB-B benchmarks. It outperforms models trained solely on real data and exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art synthetic data generation baselines. Notably, these enhancements often surpass those achieved through architectural improvements, underscoring the significant impact of synthetic augmentation in data-scarce environments. These findings demonstrate that carefully integrated synthetic data not only addresses privacy and resource constraints but also substantially boosts model performance.

More recently, researchers have used machine learning methods to speed up the process. However, for small particles in large sample volumes the performance of these methods falls short of standard physics-based reconstruction methods. Here we designed a two-stage neural network architecture, FLASH$\mu$, to detect small particles (6-100$\mu$m) from holograms with large sample depths up to 20cm. Trained only on synthetic data with added physical noise, our method reliably detects particles of at least 9$\mu$m diameter in real holograms, comparable to the standard reconstruction-based approaches while operating on smaller crops, at quarter of the original resolution and providing roughly a 600-fold speedup. In addition to introducing a novel approach to a non-local object detection or signal demixing problem, our work could enable low-cost, real-time holographic imaging setups.",14/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Given the ubiquity and information richness of vision modality inputs in real-world scenarios, Cross-vision, encompassing Vision-Language Perception (VLP) and Image-to-Image (I2I), tasks have attracted significant attention. Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) and I2I GMs are employed to handle VLP and I2I tasks, respectively. Previous research indicates that printing typographic words into input images significantly induces LVLMs and I2I GMs to generate disruptive outputs semantically related to those words. Additionally, visual prompts, as a more sophisticated form of typography, are also revealed to pose security risks to various applications of VLP tasks when injected into images. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the performance impact induced by Typographic Visual Prompt Injection (TVPI) in various LVLMs and I2I GMs. To better observe performance modifications and characteristics of this threat, we also introduce the TVPI Dataset.

It introduces additional redundancy, abrupt variations, and a domain gap between language and vision tokens while generation. Addressing these challenges requires an effective video tokenizer that can efficiently encode video data while preserving essential semantic and spatiotemporal information, serving as a critical bridge between text and vision. Inspired by the observation in VQ-VAE-2 and workflows of traditional animation, we propose HiTVideo for text-to-video generation with hierarchical tokenizers. It utilizes a 3D causal VAE with a multi-layer discrete token framework, encoding video content into hierarchically structured codebooks. Higher layers capture semantic information with higher compression, while lower layers focus on fine-grained spatiotemporal details, striking a balance between compression efficiency and reconstruction quality. Our approach efficiently encodes longer video sequences (e.g., 8 seconds, 64 frames), reducing bits per pixel (bpp) by approximately 70\% compared to baseline tokenizers, while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality. We explore the trade-offs between compression and reconstruction, while emphasizing the advantages of high-compressed semantic tokens in text-to-video tasks. HiTVideo aims to address the potential limitations of existing video tokenizers in text-to-video generation tasks, striving for higher compression ratios and simplify LLMs modeling under language guidance, offering a scalable and promising framework for advancing text to video generation.

This paper presents Cloud2BIM, an open-source software tool designed to automate the conversion of point clouds into BIM models compliant with the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard. Cloud2BIM integrates advanced algorithms for wall and slab segmentation, opening detection, and room zoning based on real wall surfaces, resulting in a comprehensive and fully automated workflow.

However, existing RMOT approaches often treat language descriptions as holistic embeddings and struggle to effectively integrate the rich semantic information contained in language expressions with visual features. This limitation is especially apparent in complex scenes requiring comprehensive understanding of both static object attributes and spatial motion information. In this paper, we propose a Cognitive Disentanglement for Referring Multi-Object Tracking (CDRMT) framework that addresses these challenges. It adapts the ""what"" and ""where"" pathways from human visual processing system to RMOT tasks. Specifically, our framework comprises three collaborative components: (1)The Bidirectional Interactive Fusion module first establishes cross-modal connections while preserving modality-specific characteristics; (2) Building upon this foundation, the Progressive Semantic-Decoupled Query Learning mechanism hierarchically injects complementary information into object queries, progressively refining object understanding from coarse to fine-grained semantic levels; (3) Finally, the Structural Consensus Constraint enforces bidirectional semantic consistency between visual features and language descriptions, ensuring that tracked objects faithfully reflect the referring expression. Extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that CDRMT achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with average gains of 6.0% in HOTA score on Refer-KITTI and 3.2% on Refer-KITTI-V2.

However, can Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) also ""reason through a sequential spatio-temporal logic"" in videos? Existing Video-LLM benchmarks primarily focus on assessing object presence, neglecting relational reasoning. Consequently, it is difficult to measure whether a model truly comprehends object interactions (actions/events) in videos or merely relies on pre-trained ""memory"" of co-occurrences as biases in generating answers. In this work, we introduce a Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (V-STaR) benchmark to address these shortcomings. The key idea is to decompose video understanding into a Reverse Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (RSTR) task that simultaneously evaluates what objects are present, when events occur, and where they are located while capturing the underlying Chain-of-thought (CoT) logic. To support this evaluation, we construct a dataset to elicit the spatial-temporal reasoning process of Video-LLMs. It contains coarse-to-fine CoT questions generated by a semi-automated GPT-4-powered pipeline, embedding explicit reasoning chains to mimic human cognition.

While they are barely observable to our eyes, computer vision manners can, and the derived remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has shown considerable promise. However, existing studies mainly rely on spatial skin recognition and temporal rhythmic interactions, so they focus on identifying explicit features under ideal light conditions, but perform poorly in-the-wild with intricate obstacles and extreme illumination exposure. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end video transformer model for rPPG. It strives to eliminate complex and unknown external time-varying interferences, whether they are sufficient to occupy subtle biosignal amplitudes or exist as periodic perturbations that hinder network training. In the specific implementation, we utilize global interference sharing, subject background reference, and self-supervised disentanglement to eliminate interference, and further guide learning based on spatiotemporal filtering, reconstruction guidance, and frequency domain and biological prior constraints to achieve effective rPPG.

Towards this end, we introduce TASTE-Rob -- a pioneering large-scale dataset of 100,856 ego-centric hand-object interaction videos. Each video is meticulously aligned with language instructions and recorded from a consistent camera viewpoint to ensure interaction clarity. By fine-tuning a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) on TASTE-Rob, we achieve realistic object interactions, though we observed occasional inconsistencies in hand grasping postures. To enhance realism, we introduce a three-stage pose-refinement pipeline that improves hand posture accuracy in generated videos. Our curated dataset, coupled with the specialized pose-refinement framework, provides notable performance gains in generating high-quality, task-oriented hand-object interaction videos, resulting in achieving superior generalizable robotic manipulation.

Most existing methods focus primarily on scene completion (i.e., filling missing regions) and lack the capability to insert new objects into a scene in a controllable manner. Fortunately, recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models pave the way for text-guided video inpainting. However, directly adapting T2V models for inpainting remains limited in unifying completion and insertion tasks, lacks input controllability, and struggles with long videos, thereby restricting their applicability and flexibility. To address these challenges, we propose MTV-Inpaint, a unified multi-task video inpainting framework capable of handling both traditional scene completion and novel object insertion tasks. To unify these distinct tasks, we design a dual-branch spatial attention mechanism in the T2V diffusion U-Net, enabling seamless integration of scene completion and object insertion within a single framework. In addition to textual guidance, MTV-Inpaint supports multimodal control by integrating various image inpainting models through our proposed image-to-video (I2V) inpainting mode. Additionally, we propose a two-stage pipeline that combines keyframe inpainting with in-between frame propagation, enabling MTV-Inpaint to effectively handle long videos with hundreds of frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTV-Inpaint achieves state-of-the-art performance in both scene completion and object insertion tasks. Furthermore, it demonstrates versatility in derived applications such as multi-modal inpainting, object editing, removal, image object brush, and the ability to handle long videos.

Corso, Eric Sax","Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold the potential to enhance autonomous driving by combining domain-independent world knowledge with context-specific language guidance. Their integration into autonomous driving systems shows promising results in isolated proof-of-concept applications, while their performance is evaluated on selective singular aspects of perception, reasoning, or planning. To leverage their full potential a systematic framework for evaluating MLLMs in the context of autonomous driving is required. This paper proposes a holistic framework for a capability-driven evaluation of MLLMs in autonomous driving. The framework structures scenario understanding along the four core capability dimensions semantic, spatial, temporal, and physical. They are derived from the general requirements of autonomous driving systems, human driver cognition, and language-based reasoning. It further organises the domain into context layers, processing modalities, and downstream tasks such as language-based interaction and decision-making. To illustrate the framework's applicability, two exemplary traffic scenarios are analysed, grounding the proposed dimensions in realistic driving situations. The framework provides a foundation for the structured evaluation of MLLMs' potential for scenario understanding in autonomous driving.",14/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

We introduce a novel approach for addressing the sparsity and heterogeneity of annotated training data inspired by the human learning procedure of watching experts and understanding their explanations. Our method leverages a video-language model trained on alignment, denoising, and generative tasks to learn short-term spatio-temporal and multimodal representations. A task-specific temporal model is then used to capture relationships across entire videos. To achieve comprehensive video-language understanding in the surgical domain, we introduce a data collection and filtering strategy to construct a large-scale pretraining dataset from educational YouTube videos. We then utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning by projecting downstream task annotations from publicly available surgical datasets into the language domain. Extensive experiments in two surgical domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with performance improvements of up to 7% in phase segmentation tasks, 8% in zero-shot phase segmentation, and comparable capabilities to fully-supervised models in few-shot settings. Harnessing our model's capabilities for long-range temporal localization and text generation, we present the first comprehensive solution for dense video captioning (DVC) of surgical videos, addressing this task despite the absence of existing DVC datasets in the surgical domain. We introduce a novel approach to surgical workflow understanding that leverages video-language pretraining, large-scale video pretraining, and optimized fine-tuning.

With the emergence of machine learning algorithms it is now easier than ever before to generate such fake content, even for private persons. This issue of generated fake images is especially critical in the context of politics and public figures. We want to address this conflict by building a model based on a Convolutions Neural Network in order to detect such generated and fake images showing human portraits. As a basis, we use a pre-trained ResNet-50 model due to its effectiveness in terms of classifying images. We then adopted the base model to our task of classifying a single image as authentic/real or fake by adding an fully connected output layer containing a single neuron indicating the authenticity of an image. We applied fine tuning and transfer learning to develop the model and improve its parameters. For the training process we collected the image data set ""Diverse Face Fake Dataset"" containing a wide range of different image manipulation methods and also diversity in terms of faces visible on the images.

The key challenge arises from depth variation induced spatio-temporal motion inconsistencies, disrupting the assumptions of local spatial or temporal motion smoothness in previous motion estimation frameworks. In contrast, event cameras offer new possibilities for 3D motion estimation through continuous adaptive pixel-level responses to scene changes. This paper presents EMoTive, a novel event-based framework that models spatio-temporal trajectories via event-guided non-uniform parametric curves, effectively characterizing locally heterogeneous spatio-temporal motion. Specifically, we first introduce Event Kymograph - an event projection method that leverages a continuous temporal projection kernel and decouples spatial observations to encode fine-grained temporal evolution explicitly. For motion representation, we introduce a density-aware adaptation mechanism to fuse spatial and temporal features under event guidance, coupled with a non-uniform rational curve parameterization framework to adaptively model heterogeneous trajectories. The final 3D motion estimation is achieved through multi-temporal sampling of parametric trajectories, yielding optical flow and depth motion fields. To facilitate evaluation, we introduce CarlaEvent3D, a multi-dynamic synthetic dataset for comprehensive validation.

While existing methods have made breakthroughs by incorporating material decomposition in the 3D generation pipeline, they tend to bake highlights into albedo and ignore spatially varying properties of metallicity and roughness. In this work, we present PBR3DGen, a two-stage mesh generation method with high-quality PBR materials that integrates the novel multi-view PBR material estimation model and a 3D PBR mesh reconstruction model. Specifically, PBR3DGen leverages vision language models (VLM) to guide multi-view diffusion, precisely capturing the spatial distribution and inherent attributes of reflective-metalness material.

To address these limitations, we introduce PARIC, a probabilistic framework for guiding visual attention via language specifications. Our approach enables pre-trained vision-language models to generate probabilistic reference attention maps, which align textual and visual modalities more effectively while incorporating uncertainty estimates, as compared to their deterministic counterparts.

Occlusions and varied viewpoints can lead to multi-view semantic inconsistencies, while dynamic objects may act as transient distractors, introducing artifacts into semantic feature modeling. To address these challenges, we propose EgoSplat, a language-embedded 3D Gaussian Splatting framework for open-vocabulary egocentric scene understanding. A multi-view consistent instance feature aggregation method is designed to leverage the segmentation and tracking capabilities of SAM2 to selectively aggregate complementary features across views for each instance, ensuring precise semantic representation of scenes. Additionally, an instance-aware spatial-temporal transient prediction module is constructed to improve spatial integrity and temporal continuity in predictions by incorporating spatial-temporal associations across multi-view instances, effectively reducing artifacts in the semantic reconstruction of egocentric scenes. EgoSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in both localization and segmentation tasks on two datasets, outperforming existing methods with a 8.2% improvement in localization accuracy and a 3.7% improvement in segmentation mIoU on the ADT dataset, and setting a new benchmark in open-vocabulary egocentric scene understanding.

Previous research on road rage regulation has primarily focused on response suppression, lacking proactive prevention capabilities. With the advent of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), it has become possible to reason about trigger events visually and then engage in dialog-based comforting before drivers' anger escalates. To this end, we propose the road rage reasoning task, along with a finely annotated test dataset and evaluation metrics, to assess the capabilities of current mainstream VLMs in scene understanding, event recognition, and road rage reasoning. The results indicate that current VLMs exhibit significant shortcomings in scene understanding within the visual modality, as well as in comprehending the spatial relationships between objects in the textual modality.

However, this task is challenging due to its fine-grained nature and dataset shifts caused by different imaging instruments and varying species distributions. As new plankton image datasets are collected at an increasing pace, there is a need for general plankton recognition models that require minimal expert effort for data labeling. In this work, we study large-scale self-supervised pretraining for fine-grained plankton recognition. We first employ masked autoencoding and a large volume of diverse plankton image data to pretrain a general-purpose plankton image encoder. Then we utilize fine-tuning to obtain accurate plankton recognition models for new datasets with a very limited number of labeled training images. Our experiments show that self-supervised pretraining with diverse plankton data clearly increases plankton recognition accuracy compared to standard ImageNet pretraining when the amount of training data is limited. Moreover, the accuracy can be further improved when unlabeled target data is available and utilized during the pretraining.",14/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

10.48550./arXiv.2503.11329,Colour Morphological Distance Ordering based on the Log-Exp-Supremum,"Marvin Kahra, Michael Breuß","Mathematical morphology, a field within image processing, includes various filters that either highlight, modify, or eliminate certain information in images based on an application's needs. Key operations in these filters are dilation and erosion, which determine the supremum or infimum for each pixel with respect to an order of the tonal values over a subset of the image surrounding the pixel. This subset is formed by a structuring element at the specified pixel, which weighs the tonal values. Unlike grey-scale morphology, where tonal order is clearly defined, colour morphology lacks a definitive total order. As no method fully meets all desired properties for colour, because of this difficulty, some limitations are always present.
This paper shows how to combine the theory of the log-exp-supremum of colour matrices that employs the Loewner semi-order with a well-known colour distance approach in the form of a pre-ordering. The log-exp-supremum will therefore serve as the reference colour for determining the colour distance. To the resulting pre-ordering with respect to these distance values, we add a lexicographic cascade to ensure a total order and a unique result. The objective of this approach is to identify the original colour within the structuring element that most closely resembles a supremum, which fulfils a number of desired properties. Consequently, this approach avoids the false-colour problem. The behaviour of the introduced operators is illustrated by application examples of dilation and closing for synthetic and natural images.",14/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Current solutions have to balance between the frame rate and image quality. High frame rates, for example, can be achieved by reducing either per-point scanning time or scanning density, but at the cost of lowering the information density at individual frames. Fast scanning process further reduces the signal-to-noise ratio and different scanning systems exhibit different distortion characteristics. In this work, we design and employ a new Transient Transformer architecture called TransiT to achieve real-time NLOS recovery under fast scans. TransiT directly compresses the temporal dimension of input transients to extract features, reducing computation costs and meeting high frame rate requirements. It further adopts a feature fusion mechanism as well as employs a spatial-temporal Transformer to help capture features of NLOS transient videos. Moreover, TransiT applies transfer learning to bridge the gap between synthetic and real-measured data. In real experiments, TransiT manages to reconstruct from sparse transients of $16 \times 16$ measured at an exposure time of 0.4 ms per point to NLOS videos at a $64 \times 64$ resolution at 10 frames per second.

In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based generative image compression method injected with diffusion knowledge, obtaining the capacity to recover more realistic textures in practical scenarios. Efforts are made from three perspectives to navigate the rate-distortion-realism trade-off in the generative image compression task. First, recognizing the strong connection between image texture and frequency-domain characteristics, we design a Fractal Frequency-Aware Band Image Compression (FFAB-IC) network to effectively capture the directional frequency components inherent in natural images. This network integrates commonly used fractal band feature operations within a neural non-linear mapping design, enhancing its ability to retain essential given information and filter out unnecessary details. Then, to improve the visual quality of image reconstruction under limited bandwidth, we integrate diffusion knowledge into the encoder and implement diffusion iterations into the decoder process, thus effectively recovering lost texture details. Finally, to fully leverage the spatial and frequency intensity information, we incorporate frequency- and content-aware regularization terms to regularize the training of the generative image compression network. Extensive experiments in quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, advancing the boundaries of achievable distortion-realism pairs, i.e., our method achieves better distortions at high realism and better realism at low distortion than ever before.",14/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Plankton include a diverse range of microscopic aquatic organisms that have an important role in marine ecosystems as primary producers and as a base of food webs. Given their sensitivity to environmental changes, fluctuations in plankton populations offer valuable information about oceans' health and climate change motivating their monitoring. Modern automatic plankton imaging devices enable the collection of large-scale plankton image datasets, facilitating species-level analysis. Plankton species recognition can be seen as an image classification task and is typically solved using deep learning-based image recognition models. However, data collection in real aquatic environments results in imaging devices capturing a variety of non-plankton particles and plankton species not present in the training set. This creates a challenging fine-grained OSR problem, characterized by subtle differences between taxonomically close plankton species. We address this challenge by conducting extensive experiments on three OSR approaches using both phyto- and zooplankton images analyzing also on the effect of the rejection thresholds for OSR. The results demonstrate that high OSR accuracy can be obtained promoting the use of these methods in operational plankton research.

Current spatiotemporal forecasting models primarily rely on convolution operations or sliding windows for feature extraction. These methods are limited by the size of the convolutional kernel or sliding window, making it difficult to capture and identify potential teleconnection features in meteorological data. Additionally, weather data often involve non-rigid bodies, whose motion processes are accompanied by unpredictable deformations, further complicating the forecasting task. In this paper, we propose the GMG model to address these two core challenges. The Global Focus Module, a key component of our model, enhances the global receptive field, while the Motion Guided Module adapts to the growth or dissipation processes of non-rigid bodies.

Although this approach aids in concentrating on salient features and diminishing computational burden, it incurs the loss of vital detailed information, a drawback that is particularly damaging in end-to-end autonomous driving scenarios. Downsampling can lead to an inadequate capture of distant or small objects such as pedestrians, road signs, or obstacles, all of which are crucial for safe navigation. This loss of features negatively impacts an autonomous driving system's capacity to accurately perceive the environment, potentially escalating the risk of accidents. To tackle this problem, we put forward the Dynamic Resolution Vision Language Model (DynRsl-VLM).

As a remedy, synthesizing realistic low-light noise has gained significant attention. In this paper, we investigate the ability of diffusion models to capture the complex distribution of low-light noise. We show that a naive application of conventional diffusion models is inadequate for this task and propose three key adaptations that enable high-precision noise generation without calibration or post-processing: a two-branch architecture to better model signal-dependent and signal-independent noise, the incorporation of positional information to capture fixed-pattern noise, and a tailored diffusion noise schedule.

Our analysis reveals that shallower fusion yields smaller distribution gap. However, the limited discriminative power of shallow networks hard to distinguish task-relevant information from noise, limiting the potential of pixel-level fusion. To break shallow limits, we propose a novel \textbf{T}ask-driven \textbf{P}ixel-level \textbf{F}usion network, named \textbf{TPF}, which unveils the power of pixel-level fusion in RGBT tracking through a progressive learning framework. In particular, we design a lightweight Pixel-level Fusion Adapter (PFA) that exploits Mamba's linear complexity to ensure real-time, low-latency RGBT tracking. To enhance the fusion capabilities of the PFA, our task-driven progressive learning framework first utilizes adaptive multi-expert distillation to inherits fusion knowledge from state-of-the-art image fusion models, establishing robust initialization, and then employs a decoupled representation learning scheme to achieve task-relevant information fusion. Moreover, to overcome appearance variations between the initial template and search frames, we presents a nearest-neighbor dynamic template updating scheme, which selects the most reliable frame closest to the current search frame as the dynamic template.

This approach enables large-scale retrieval and cross-scene generalization without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on XA-L&RSI demonstrate that, within a $100km^2$ retrieval range, L2RSI accurately localizes $95.08\%$ of point cloud submaps within a $30m$ radius for top-$1$ retrieved location.

However, their practical applications are hindered by the misalignment between generated images and corresponding text prompts. To tackle this issue, reinforcement learning (RL) has been considered for diffusion model fine-tuning. Yet, RL's effectiveness is limited by the challenge of sparse reward, where feedback is only available at the end of the generation process. This makes it difficult to identify which actions during the denoising process contribute positively to the final generated image, potentially leading to ineffective or unnecessary denoising policies. To this end, this paper presents a novel RL-based framework that addresses the sparse reward problem when training diffusion models. Our framework, named $\text{B}^2\text{-DiffuRL}$, employs two strategies: \textbf{B}ackward progressive training and \textbf{B}ranch-based sampling. For one thing, backward progressive training focuses initially on the final timesteps of denoising process and gradually extends the training interval to earlier timesteps, easing the learning difficulty from sparse rewards. For another, we perform branch-based sampling for each training interval. By comparing the samples within the same branch, we can identify how much the policies of the current training interval contribute to the final image, which helps to learn effective policies instead of unnecessary ones. $\text{B}^2\text{-DiffuRL}$ is compatible with existing optimization algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of $\text{B}^2\text{-DiffuRL}$ in improving prompt-image alignment and maintaining diversity in generated images.

In this paper, we explore the use of neuromorphic cameras for passive optical wireless communication (OWC), leveraging their asynchronous detection of illumination changes to decode data transmitted through reflections of light from objects. We propose a novel system that utilizes neuromorphic cameras for passive visible light communication (VLC), extending the concept to Non Line-of-Sight (NLoS) scenarios through passive reflections from everyday objects. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of using neuromorphic cameras for VLC, characterizing the performance of various modulation schemes, including traditional On-Off Keying (OOK) and advanced N-pulse modulation. We introduce an adaptive N-pulse modulation scheme that dynamically adjusts encoding based on the packet's bit composition, achieving higher data rates and robustness in different scenarios. Our results show that lighter-colored, glossy objects are better for NLoS communication, while larger objects and those with matte finishes experience higher error rates due to multipath reflections.",14/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

However, this assumption is flawed due to the sensor and optical limitations of modern imaging systems. Moreover, recent generative enhancement methods are capable of producing images of higher quality than their original. All of these challenge the effectiveness and applicability of current FR-IQA models. To relax the assumption of perfect reference image quality, we build a large-scale IQA database, namely DiffIQA, containing approximately 180,000 images generated by a diffusion-based image enhancer with adjustable hyper-parameters. Each image is annotated by human subjects as either worse, similar, or better quality compared to its reference. Building on this, we present a generalized FR-IQA model, namely Adaptive Fidelity-Naturalness Evaluator (A-FINE), to accurately assess and adaptively combine the fidelity and naturalness of a test image. A-FINE aligns well with standard FR-IQA when the reference image is much more natural than the test image. We demonstrate by extensive experiments that A-FINE surpasses standard FR-IQA models on well-established IQA datasets and our newly created DiffIQA. To further validate A-FINE, we additionally construct a super-resolution IQA benchmark (SRIQA-Bench), encompassing test images derived from ten state-of-the-art SR methods with reliable human quality annotations. Tests on SRIQA-Bench re-affirm the advantages of A-FINE. The code and dataset are available at this https URL.",14/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

However, existing approaches often rely on manually zooming remote sensing images at different scales to create typical scene samples. This approach fails to adequately support the fixed-resolution image interpretation requirements in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce the Million-scale finE-grained geospatial scEne classification dataseT (MEET), which contains over 1.03 million zoom-free remote sensing scene samples, manually annotated into 80 fine-grained categories. In MEET, each scene sample follows a scene-inscene layout, where the central scene serves as the reference, and auxiliary scenes provide crucial spatial context for finegrained classification. Moreover, to tackle the emerging challenge of scene-in-scene classification, we present the Context-Aware Transformer (CAT), a model specifically designed for this task, which adaptively fuses spatial context to accurately classify the scene samples. CAT adaptively fuses spatial context to accurately classify the scene samples by learning attentional features that capture the relationships between the center and auxiliary scenes. Based on MEET, we establish a comprehensive benchmark for fine-grained geospatial scene classification, evaluating CAT against 11 competitive baselines. The results demonstrate that CAT significantly outperforms these baselines, achieving a 1.88% higher balanced accuracy (BA) with the Swin-Large backbone, and a notable 7.87% improvement with the Swin-Huge backbone. Further experiments validate the effectiveness of each module in CAT and show the practical applicability of CAT in the urban functional zone mapping.

Although promising tracking performance is achieved through leveraging complementary cues from different sources, it remains challenging in complex scenes due to the limitations of bi-modal scenarios. In this work, we introduce a general multimodal visual tracking task that fully exploits the advantages of four modalities, including RGB, thermal infrared, event, and language, for robust tracking under challenging conditions. To provide a comprehensive evaluation platform for general multimodal visual tracking, we construct QuadTrack600, a large-scale, high-quality benchmark comprising 600 video sequences (totaling 384.7K high-resolution (640x480) frame groups). In each frame group, all four modalities are spatially aligned and meticulously annotated with bounding boxes, while 21 sequence-level challenge attributes are provided for detailed performance analysis. Despite quad-modal data provides richer information, the differences in information quantity among modalities and the computational burden from four modalities are two challenging issues in fusing four modalities. To handle these issues, we propose a novel approach called QuadFusion, which incorporates an efficient Multiscale Fusion Mamba with four different scanning scales to achieve sufficient interactions of the four modalities while overcoming the exponential computational burden, for general multimodal visual tracking.

However, since the DP image features are entirely determined by the camera hardware, DP-depth paired datasets are very scarce, especially when performing depth estimation on customized cameras. To overcome this, studies simulate DP images using ideal optical system models. However, these simulations often violate real optical propagation laws,leading to poor generalization to real DP data. To address this, we investigate the domain gap between simulated and real DP data, and propose solutions using the Simulating DP images from ray tracing (Sdirt) scheme. The Sdirt generates realistic DP images via ray tracing and integrates them into the depth estimation training pipeline.

A key challenge in such approaches is the difficulty of retaining essential visual and temporal information, constrained by the token limits in Image LLMs. To address this, we propose a two-stage method for selecting query-relevant tokens based on the LLM attention scores: compressing the video sequence and then expanding the sequence. However, during the compression stage, Image LLMs often exhibit a positional attention bias in video sequences, where attention is overly concentrated on later frames, causing early-frame information to be underutilized. To alleviate this attention bias during sequence compression, we propose Gridded Attention Pooling for preserving spatiotemporal structure. Additionally, we introduce Visual Summarization Tail to effectively utilize this bias, facilitating overall video understanding during sequence expansion. In this way, our method effectively Mitigates and Leverages attention Bias (LLaVA-MLB), enabling the frozen Image LLM for detailed video understanding.

Furthermore, the newly proposed architecture exhibits a significant performance improvement in the presence of only sparse and noisy data, which is demonstrated through comparative experiments on synthetic data. The module is embedded into the back-end of a stereo-vision based framework for joint, incremental shape optimization. The loss function is given by a combination of a sparse 3D point-based SDF loss, a sparse rendering loss, and a semantic mask-based silhouette-consistency term. We furthermore leverage semantic information to determine keypoint extraction density in the front-end. Finally, experimental results on real-world data reveal accurate and reliable performance comparable to alternative frameworks that make use of direct depth readings.

Conventional image watermarking methods are vulnerable to common transformations like filters, lossy compression, and screenshots, often applied during social media sharing. Watermarks can also be faked or removed if models are open-sourced or leaked since images can be rewatermarked. We have developed a three-part framework for secure, transformation-resilient AI content provenance detection, to address these limitations. We develop an adversarially robust state-of-the-art perceptual hashing model, DinoHash, derived from DINOV2, which is robust to common transformations like filters, compression, and crops. Additionally, we integrate a Multi-Party Fully Homomorphic Encryption~(MP-FHE) scheme into our proposed framework to ensure the protection of both user queries and registry privacy. Furthermore, we improve previous work on AI-generated media detection. This approach is useful in cases where the content is absent from our registry. DinoHash significantly improves average bit accuracy by 12% over state-of-the-art watermarking and perceptual hashing methods while maintaining superior true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) tradeoffs across various transformations. Our AI-generated media detection results show a 25% improvement in classification accuracy on commonly used real-world AI image generators over existing algorithms.

Comparing adaptations reveals the challenge of limiting estimation errors while preserving accurate pose information. To this end, we propose adaptive aggregation, a two-stage optimization, and local augmentation for handling varying levels of estimated pose error. First, we perform adaptive aggregation across videos to initialize the model state with labeled representative samples. Within each video, we use a two-stage optimization to benefit from 2D fitting while minimizing the impact of erroneous updates.

Leveraging this insight, we propose Dynamic Density Pruning for Fast Video LLMs termed FastVID. Specifically, FastVID dynamically partitions videos into temporally ordered segments to preserve temporal structure and applies a density-based token pruning strategy to maintain essential visual information. Our method significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining temporal and visual integrity.

The main reason is that some lesion regions in medical images have unclear boundaries, irregular shapes, and small tissue density differences, leading to label ambiguity. However, the existing model treats all data equally without taking quality differences into account in the training process, resulting in noisy labels negatively impacting model training and unstable feature representations. In this paper, a data-driven alternating learning (DALE) paradigm is proposed to optimize the model's training process, achieving stable and high-precision segmentation. The paradigm focuses on two key points: (1) reducing the impact of noisy labels, and (2) calibrating unstable representations. To mitigate the negative impact of noisy labels, a loss consistency-based collaborative optimization method is proposed, and its effectiveness is theoretically demonstrated. Specifically, the label confidence parameters are introduced to dynamically adjust the influence of labels of different confidence levels during model training, thus reducing the influence of noise labels. To calibrate the learning bias of unstable representations, a distribution alignment method is proposed.

However, current EQA approaches suffer from critical limitations in exploration efficiency, dataset design, and evaluation metrics. Moreover, existing datasets often introduce biases or prior knowledge, leading to disembodied reasoning, while frontier-based exploration strategies struggle in cluttered environments and fail to ensure fine-grained exploration of task-relevant areas. To address these challenges, we construct the EXPloration-awaRe Embodied queStion anSwering Benchmark (EXPRESS-Bench), the largest dataset designed specifically to evaluate both exploration and reasoning capabilities. EXPRESS-Bench consists of 777 exploration trajectories and 2,044 question-trajectory pairs. To improve exploration efficiency, we propose Fine-EQA, a hybrid exploration model that integrates frontier-based and goal-oriented navigation to guide agents toward task-relevant regions more effectively.

However, little is known about the inner workings of CLIP. While recent work has proposed decomposition-based interpretability methods for identifying textual descriptions of attention heads in CLIP, the implications of conceptual consistency in these text labels on interpretability and model performance has not been explored. To bridge this gap, we study the conceptual consistency of text descriptions for attention heads in CLIP-like models. We conduct extensive experiments on six different models from OpenAI and OpenCLIP which vary by size, type of pre-training data and patch size. We propose Concept Consistency Score (CCS), a novel interpretability metric that measures how consistently individual attention heads in CLIP models align with specific concepts. To assign concept labels to heads, we use in-context learning with ChatGPT, guided by a few manually-curated examples, and validate these labels using an LLM-as-a-judge approach. Our soft-pruning experiments reveal that high CCS heads are critical for preserving model performance, as pruning them leads to a significantly larger performance drop than pruning random or low CCS heads. Notably, we find that high CCS heads capture essential concepts and play a key role in out-of-domain detection, concept-specific reasoning, and video-language understanding. These results position CCS as a powerful interpretability metric for analyzing CLIP-like models.",14/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

In this work, we systematically investigate the role of loss surface flatness in generative models, both theoretically and empirically, with a particular focus on diffusion models. We establish a theoretical claim that flatter minima improve robustness against perturbations in target prior distributions, leading to benefits such as reduced exposure bias -- where errors in noise estimation accumulate over iterations -- and significantly improved resilience to model quantization, preserving generative performance even under strong quantization constraints. We further observe that Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), which explicitly controls the degree of flatness, effectively enhances flatness in diffusion models, whereas other well-known methods such as Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which promote flatness indirectly via ensembling, are less effective.

In addition, we reveal that the image token entropy reflects the image structure and present a entropy-based Top-k sampling strategy to optimize the local structure of the image during inference. Experimental results demonstrate that PURE preserves image content while generating realistic details, especially in complex scenes with multiple objects, showcasing the potential of autoregressive multimodal generative models for robust Real-ISR.

However, training these models requires large amounts of labeled data, which is time-consuming and expensive. Considering that the real-world driving data exhibits a long-tailed distribution where simple scenarios constitute a majority part of the data, we are thus inspired to identify the most challenging scenarios within it. Subsequently, we can efficiently improve the performance of the model by training with the selected data of the highest value. Prior research has focused on the selection of valuable data by empirically designed strategies. However, manually designed methods suffer from being less generalizable to new data distributions. Observing that the BEV (Bird's Eye View) features in end-to-end models contain all the information required to represent the scenario, we propose an active learning framework that relies on these vectorized scene-level features, called SEAD.

While current models have served as assistants to human designers in various design tasks, they typically handle only segments of the creative design process or produce pixel-based outputs that limit editability. This paper introduces a training-free framework for fully automated banner ad design creation, enabling frontier multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to streamline the production of effective banners with minimal manual effort across diverse marketing contexts. We present BannerAgency, an MLLM agent system that collaborates with advertisers to understand their brand identity and banner objectives, generates matching background images, creates blueprints for foreground design elements, and renders the final creatives as editable components in Figma or SVG formats rather than static pixels.

Diffusion autoencoders have been proposed in prior work as a way to learn end-to-end perceptually-oriented image compression, but have not yet shown state-of-the-art performance on the competitive task of ImageNet-1K reconstruction.

Seeking for collaboration is a promising solution to resolve this dilemma, where multiple institutions can collaboratively train RSFMs without sharing private data. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserved pre-training framework (FedSense), which enables multiple institutions to collaboratively train RSFMs without sharing private data.

However, existing methods often struggle with effectively integrating visual observations and instruction details during navigation, leading to suboptimal path planning and limited success rates. In this paper, we propose OIKG (Observation-graph Interaction and Key-detail Guidance), a novel framework that addresses these limitations through two key components: (1) an observation-graph interaction module that decouples angular and visual information while strengthening edge representations in the navigation space, and (2) a key-detail guidance module that dynamically extracts and utilizes fine-grained location and object information from instructions. By enabling more precise cross-modal alignment and dynamic instruction interpretation, our approach significantly improves the agent's ability to follow complex navigation instructions. Extensive experiments on the R2R and RxR datasets demonstrate that OIKG achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing navigation precision through better observation-instruction alignment.",14/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

However, to mitigate the misalignment between upstream image-text pretraining and downstream region-level perception, additional supervisions are indispensable, eg, image-text pairs or pseudo annotations generated via self-training strategies. In this work, we propose CCKT-Det trained without any extra supervision. The proposed framework constructs a cyclic and dynamic knowledge transfer from language queries and visual region features extracted from VLMs, which forces the detector to closely align with the visual-semantic space of VLMs. Specifically, 1) we prefilter and inject semantic priors to guide the learning of queries, and 2) introduce a regional contrastive loss to improve the awareness of queries on novel objects. CCKT-Det can consistently improve performance as the scale of VLMs increases, all while requiring the detector at a moderate level of computation overhead. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves performance gain of +2.9% and +10.2% AP50 over previous state-of-the-arts on the challenging COCO benchmark, both without and with a stronger teacher model.

We initially perform a comprehensive analysis of seven prominent action recognition methods across five widely-used datasets. This analysis reveals a critical, yet previously overlooked, observation: as the velocity of actions increases, the performance of these methods variably declines, undermining their robustness. This decline in performance poses significant challenges for their application in real-world scenarios. Building on these findings, we introduce the Velocity-Aware Action Recognition (VA-AR) framework to obtain robust action representations across different velocities. Our principal insight is that rapid actions (e.g., the giant circle backward in uneven bars or a smash in badminton) occur within short time intervals, necessitating smaller temporal attention windows to accurately capture intricate changes. Conversely, slower actions (e.g., drinking water or wiping face) require larger windows to effectively encompass the broader context. VA-AR employs a Mixture of Window Attention (MoWA) strategy, dynamically adjusting its attention window size based on the action's velocity. This adjustment enables VA-AR to obtain a velocity-aware representation, thereby enhancing the accuracy of action recognition. Extensive experiments confirm that VA-AR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the same five datasets, demonstrating VA-AR's effectiveness across a broad spectrum of action recognition scenarios.",14/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Recent approaches have significantly improved the accuracy of rotation-invariant recognition by encoding the rotational invariance of shapes as hand-crafted image features and introducing deep neural networks. However, the methods based on pixels have too much redundant information, and the critical geometric information is prone to early leakage, resulting in weak rotation-invariant recognition of fine-grained shapes. In this paper, we reconsider the shape recognition problem from the perspective of contour points rather than pixels. We propose an anti-noise rotation-invariant convolution module based on contour geometric aware for fine-grained shape recognition. The module divides the shape contour into multiple local geometric regions(LGA), where we implement finer-grained rotation-invariant coding in terms of point topological relations. We provide a deep network composed of five such cascaded modules for classification and retrieval experiments. The results show that our method exhibits excellent performance in rotation-invariant recognition of fine-grained shapes. In addition, we demonstrate that our method is robust to contour noise and the rotation centers. The source code is available at this https URL.",14/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

To address this, multi-view detection systems have been utilized to aggregate information from multiple perspectives. Recent advances in multi-view detection utilized an early-fusion strategy that strategically projects the features onto the ground plane, where detection analysis is performed. A promising approach in this context is the use of 3D feature-pulling technique, which constructs a 3D feature volume of the scene by sampling the corresponding 2D features for each voxel. However, it creates a 3D feature volume of the whole scene without considering the potential locations of pedestrians. In this paper, we introduce a novel model that efficiently leverages traditional 3D reconstruction techniques to enhance deep multi-view pedestrian detection. This is accomplished by complementing the 3D feature volume with probabilistic occupancy volume, which is constructed using the visual hull technique. The probabilistic occupancy volume focuses the model's attention on regions occupied by pedestrians and improves detection accuracy. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art models on the MultiviewX dataset, with an MODA of 97.3%, while achieving competitive performance on the Wildtrack dataset.",14/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Our approach is label-free, efficient, and preserves the underlying classifier's distribution and reasoning processes. We thus unlock several text-based interpretability applications for any classifier. We apply our method on 40 visual classifiers and demonstrate two primary applications: 1) building both label-free and zero-shot concept bottleneck models and therefore converting any classifier to be inherently-interpretable and 2) zero-shot decoding of visual features into natural language. In both applications, we achieve state-of-the-art results, greatly outperforming existing works. Our method enables text approaches for interpreting visual classifiers.",14/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

We identify two key challenges in enabling DFQ for VMMs, (1) VMM's recurrent state transitions restricts capturing of long-range interactions and leads to semantically weak synthetic data, (2) VMM activations exhibit dynamic outlier variations across time-steps, rendering existing static PTQ techniques ineffective. To address these challenges, OuroMamba presents a two-stage framework: (1) OuroMamba-Gen to generate semantically rich and meaningful synthetic data. It applies contrastive learning on patch level VMM features generated through neighborhood interactions in the latent state space, (2) OuroMamba-Quant to employ mixed-precision quantization with lightweight dynamic outlier detection during inference. In specific, we present a thresholding based outlier channel selection strategy for activations that gets updated every time-step. Extensive experiments across vision and generative tasks show that our data-free OuroMamba surpasses existing data-driven PTQ techniques, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse quantization settings.

This study aims to develop a computationally efficient tomato classification model using the ResNet-18 architecture optimized through transfer learning, pruning, and quantization techniques. Our objective is to address the dual challenge of maintaining high accuracy while enabling real-time performance on low-power edge devices. Then, these models were deployed on an edge device to investigate their performance for tomato maturity classification.

However, a key challenge in MAD lies in its limited generalizability to unseen data and its lack of explainability-critical for practical application environments such as enrolment stations and automated border control systems. Recognizing that most existing MAD algorithms rely on supervised learning paradigms, this work explores a novel approach to MAD using zero-shot learning leveraged on Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose two types of zero-shot MAD algorithms: one leveraging general vision models and the other utilizing multimodal LLMs. For general vision models, we address the MAD task by computing the mean support embedding of an independent support set without using morphed images. For the LLM-based approach, we employ the state-of-the-art GPT-4 Turbo API with carefully crafted prompts. To evaluate the feasibility of zero-shot MAD and the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we constructed a print-scan morph dataset featuring various unseen morphing algorithms, simulating challenging real-world application scenarios. Experimental results demonstrated notable detection accuracy, validating the applicability of zero-shot learning for MAD tasks. Additionally, our investigation into LLM-based MAD revealed that multimodal LLMs, such as ChatGPT, exhibit remarkable generalizability to untrained MAD tasks. Furthermore, they possess a unique ability to provide explanations and guidance, which can enhance transparency and usability for end-users in practical applications.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

In this paper, we show that body embeddings perform better than face embeddings for cross-spectral person identification in medium-wave infrared (MWIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) domains. Due to the lack of multi-domain datasets, previous research on cross-spectral body identification - also known as Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) - has primarily focused on individual infrared bands, such as near-infrared (NIR) or LWIR, separately. We address the multi-domain body recognition problem using the IARPA Janus Benchmark Multi-Domain Face (IJB-MDF) dataset, which enables matching of short-wave infrared (SWIR), MWIR, and LWIR images against RGB (VIS) images. We leverage a vision transformer architecture to establish benchmark results on the IJB-MDF dataset and, through extensive experiments, provide valuable insights into the interrelation of infrared domains, the adaptability of VIS-pretrained models, the role of local semantic features in body-embeddings, and effective training strategies for small datasets.

However, the conventional lossy image compression algorithms are primarily designed for the Human Vision System (HVS), which can non-trivially compromise the DNNs' validation accuracy after compression, as noted in \cite{liu2018deepn}. Thus developing an image compression algorithm for both human and machine (DNNs) is on the horizon.
To address the challenge mentioned above, in this paper, we first formulate the image compression as a multi-objective optimization problem which take both human and machine prespectives into account, then we solve it by linear combination, and proposed a novel distortion measure for both human and machine, dubbed Human and Machine-Oriented Error (HMOE). After that, we develop Human And Machine Oriented Soft Decision Quantization (HMOSDQ) based on HMOE, a lossy image compression algorithm for both human and machine (DNNs), and fully complied with JPEG format. In order to evaluate the performance of HMOSDQ, finally we conduct the experiments for two pre-trained well-known DNN-based image classifiers named Alexnet \cite{Alexnet} and VGG-16 \cite{simonyan2014VGG} on two subsets of the ImageNet \cite{deng2009imagenet} validation set: one subset included images with shorter side in the range of 496 to 512, while the other included images with shorter side in the range of 376 to 384. Our results demonstrate that HMOSDQ outperforms the default JPEG algorithm in terms of rate-accuracy and rate-distortion performance. For the Alexnet comparing with the default JPEG algorithm, HMOSDQ can improve the validation accuracy by more than $0.81\%$ at $0.61$ BPP, or equivalently reduce the compression rate of default JPEG by $9.6\times$ while maintaining the same validation accuracy.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Due to the limited memory of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), most current 3D GAN models are trained on low-resolution medical images, these models cannot scale to high-resolution or are susceptible to patchy artifacts. In this work, we propose an end-to-end novel GAN architecture that uses Conditional Random field (CRF) to model dependencies so that it can generate consistent 3D medical Images without exploiting memory. To achieve this purpose, the generator is divided into two parts during training, the first part produces an intermediate representation and CRF is applied to this intermediate representation to capture correlations. The second part of the generator produces a random sub-volume of image using a subset of the intermediate representation. This structure has two advantages: first, the correlations are modeled by using the features that the generator is trying to optimize. Second, the generator can generate full high-resolution images during inference.

This paper introduces Trajectory Mamba, a novel efficient trajectory prediction framework based on the selective state-space model (SSM). Conventional attention-based models face the challenge of computational costs that grow quadratically with the number of targets, hindering their application in highly dynamic environments. In response, we leverage the SSM to redesign the self-attention mechanism in the encoder-decoder architecture, thereby achieving linear time complexity. To address the potential reduction in prediction accuracy resulting from modifications to the attention mechanism, we propose a joint polyline encoding strategy to better capture the associations between static and dynamic contexts, ultimately enhancing prediction accuracy. Additionally, to balance prediction accuracy and inference speed, we adopted the decoder that differs entirely from the encoder. Through cross-state space attention, all target agents share the scene context, allowing the SSM to interact with the shared scene representation during decoding, thus inferring different trajectories over the next prediction steps. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of inference speed and parameter efficiency on both the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets. It demonstrates a four-fold reduction in FLOPs compared to existing methods and reduces parameter count by over 40% while surpassing the performance of the vast majority of previous methods.

However, traditional AI pipelines based on deep neural visual architectures such as CNNs or ViTs face limitations such as degraded performance on the long-tail of classes and the inability to reason about their predictions. We integrate image captioning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) to enhance biodiversity monitoring, showing particular promise for characterizing rare and unknown arthropod species. While a naive Vision-Language Model (VLM) excels in classifying images of common species, the RAG model enables classification of rarer taxa by matching explicit textual descriptions of taxonomic features to contextual biodiversity text data from external sources. The RAG model shows promise in reducing overconfidence and enhancing accuracy relative to naive LLMs, suggesting its viability in capturing the nuances of taxonomic hierarchy, particularly at the challenging family and genus levels.

This module guides the model to pay attention to the most discriminative part of an image. This enables the model to attain a better performance by an end-to-end training. In standard approaches, a spatial attention map is generated in a position-wise fashion. We observe that this results in very irregular boundaries. This could make it difficult to generalize to new samples. In our method, the attention region is constrained to be rectangular. This rectangle is parametrized by only 5 parameters, allowing for a better stability and generalization to new samples. In our experiments, our method systematically outperforms the position-wise counterpart. Thus, this provides us a novel useful spatial attention mechanism for convolutional models.

Our key contribution is separating the view synthesis process into two tasks of reconstructing visible regions and hallucinating missing regions, and introducing two personalized diffusion models, each tailored to one of these tasks. Specifically, one model ('repair') takes a rendered image as input and predicts the corresponding high-quality image, which in turn is used as a pseudo ground truth image to constrain the optimization. The other model ('inpainting') primarily focuses on hallucinating details in unobserved areas. To integrate these models effectively, we introduce a two-stage optimization strategy: the first stage reconstructs visible areas using the repair model, and the second stage reconstructs missing regions with the inpainting model while ensuring coherence through further optimization. Moreover, we augment the optimization with a novel Gaussian initialization method that obtains per-image depth by combining 3D-consistent and smooth depth with highly detailed relative depth. We demonstrate that by separating the process into two tasks and addressing them with the repair and inpainting models, we produce results with detailed textures in both visible and missing regions that outperform state-of-the-art approaches on a diverse set of scenes with extremely sparse inputs.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Little","Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs), trained on extensive datasets of image-text pairs, exhibit strong multimodal understanding capabilities by implicitly learning associations between textual descriptions and image regions. This emergent ability enables zero-shot object detection and segmentation, using techniques that rely on text-image attention maps, without necessarily training on abundant labeled segmentation datasets. However, performance of such methods depends heavily on prompt engineering and manually selected layers or head choices for the attention layers. In this work, we demonstrate that, rather than relying solely on textual prompts, providing a single visual example for each category and fine-tuning the text-to-image attention layers and embeddings significantly improves the performance. Additionally, we propose learning an ensemble through few-shot fine-tuning across multiple layers and/or prompts. An entropy-based ranking and selection mechanism for text-to-image attention layers is proposed to identify the top-performing layers without the need for segmentation labels. This eliminates the need for hyper-parameter selection of text-to-image attention layers, providing a more flexible and scalable solution for open-vocabulary segmentation. We show that this approach yields strong zero-shot performance, further enhanced through fine-tuning with a single visual example.

It expands the perception range of autonomous vehicles, enhances the road safety. Previous methods focused on predicting per-pixel height rather than depth, making significant gains in roadside visual perception.

BEV features and voxel features present the real distribution of objects in 3D world compared to the image features. However, BEV features tend to lose details due to the lack of explicit height information, and voxel features are computationally expensive. Inspired by this insight, an efficient framework learning height prediction in voxel features via transformer is proposed, dubbed HeightFormer. It groups the voxel features into local height sequences, and utilize attention mechanism to obtain height distribution prediction. Subsequently, the local height sequences are reassembled to generate accurate 3D features. The proposed method is applied to two large-scale roadside benchmarks, DAIR-V2X-I and Rope3D.

While conventional approaches treat the text modality as a conditioning signal that gradually guides the denoising process from Gaussian noise to the target image modality, we explore a much simpler paradigm-directly evolving between text and image modalities through flow matching. This requires projecting both modalities into a shared latent space, which poses a significant challenge due to their inherently different representations: text is highly semantic and encoded as 1D tokens, whereas images are spatially redundant and represented as 2D latent embeddings. To address this, we introduce FlowTok, a minimal framework that seamlessly flows across text and images by encoding images into a compact 1D token representation. Compared to prior methods, this design reduces the latent space size by 3.3x at an image resolution of 256, eliminating the need for complex conditioning mechanisms or noise scheduling. Moreover, FlowTok naturally extends to image-to-text generation under the same formulation. With its streamlined architecture centered around compact 1D tokens, FlowTok is highly memory-efficient, requires significantly fewer training resources, and achieves much faster sampling speeds-all while delivering performance comparable to state-of-the-art models.

We introduce UniVLG, a unified architecture for 2D and 3D vision-language understanding that bridges the gap between existing 2D-centric models and the rich 3D sensory data available in embodied systems. Our approach initializes most model weights from pre-trained 2D models and trains on both 2D and 3D vision-language data. We propose a novel language-conditioned mask decoder shared across 2D and 3D modalities to ground objects effectively in both RGB and RGB-D images, outperforming box-based approaches. To further reduce the domain gap between 2D and 3D, we incorporate 2D-to-3D lifting strategies, enabling UniVLG to utilize 2D data to enhance 3D performance. With these innovations, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple 3D vision-language grounding tasks, demonstrating the potential of transferring advances from 2D vision-language learning to the data-constrained 3D domain. Furthermore, co-training on both 2D and 3D data enhances performance across modalities without sacrificing 2D capabilities.

The subnets are typically trained with a static training strategy (e.g., using the same learning rate (LR) scheduler and optimizer for all subnets). This, however, does not consider that individual subnets have distinct characteristics, leading to two problems: (1) The supernet training is biased towards the low-complexity subnets (unfairness); (2) the momentum update in the supernet is noisy (noisy momentum). We present a dynamic supernet training technique to address these problems by adjusting the training strategy adaptive to the subnets. Specifically, we introduce a complexity-aware LR scheduler (CaLR) that controls the decay ratio of LR adaptive to the complexities of subnets, which alleviates the unfairness problem. We also present a momentum separation technique (MS). It groups the subnets with similar structural characteristics and uses a separate momentum for each group, avoiding the noisy momentum problem. Our approach can be applicable to various N-shot NAS methods with marginal cost, while improving the search performance drastically. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on various search spaces (e.g., NAS-Bench-201, Mobilenet spaces) and datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet).",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

While studies on polarization in news media have extensively focused on verbal content, non-verbal elements, particularly visual content, have received less attention due to the complexity and high dimensionality of image data. Traditional descriptive approaches often rely on feature extraction from images, leading to biased polarization estimates due to information loss. In this paper, we introduce the Polarization Measurement using Counterfactual Image Generation (PMCIG) method, which combines economic theory with generative models and multi-modal deep learning to fully utilize the richness of image data and provide a theoretically grounded measure of polarization in visual content. Applying this framework to a decade-long dataset featuring 30 prominent politicians across 20 major news outlets, we identify significant polarization in visual content, with notable variations across outlets and politicians. At the news outlet level, we observe significant heterogeneity in visual slant. Outlets such as Daily Mail, Fox News, and Newsmax tend to favor Republican politicians in their visual content, while The Washington Post, USA Today, and The New York Times exhibit a slant in favor of Democratic politicians. At the politician level, our results reveal substantial variation in polarized coverage, with Donald Trump and Barack Obama among the most polarizing figures, while Joe Manchin and Susan Collins are among the least. Finally, we conduct a series of validation tests demonstrating the consistency of our proposed measures with external measures of media slant that rely on non-image-based sources.",13/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have expanded the capabilities of ZSL, allowing models to perform tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, applying VLMs to histopathology presents considerable challenges due to the complexity of histopathological imagery and the nuanced nature of diagnostic tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Multi-Resolution Prompt-guided Hybrid Embedding (MR-PHE) to address these challenges in zero-shot histopathology image classification. MR-PHE leverages multiresolution patch extraction to mimic the diagnostic workflow of pathologists, capturing both fine-grained cellular details and broader tissue structures critical for accurate diagnosis. We introduce a hybrid embedding strategy that integrates global image embeddings with weighted patch embeddings, effectively combining local and global contextual information. Additionally, we develop a comprehensive prompt generation and selection framework, enriching class descriptions with domain-specific synonyms and clinically relevant features to enhance semantic understanding. A similarity-based patch weighting mechanism assigns attention-like weights to patches based on their relevance to class embeddings, emphasizing diagnostically important regions during classification. Our approach utilizes pretrained VLM, CONCH for ZSL without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning, offering scalability and reducing dependence on large annotated datasets.

In order to leverage of the development in 2D EOT and balance the number of parameters of a shape model in the tracking algorithms, we propose a method for 3D extended object tracking (EOT) by describing the side view profile of the object with B-spline curves and forming an extrusion to obtain a 3D extent. The use of B-spline curves exploits their flexible representation power by allowing the control points to move freely. The algorithm is developed into an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).

We first develop Meta-ARVDM, a unified framework of ARVDMs that subsumes most existing methods. Using Meta-ARVDM, we analyze the KL-divergence between the videos generated by Meta-ARVDM and the true videos. Our analysis uncovers two important phenomena inherent to ARVDM -- error accumulation and memory bottleneck. By deriving an information-theoretic impossibility result, we show that the memory bottleneck phenomenon cannot be avoided. To mitigate the memory bottleneck, we design various network structures to explicitly use more past frames. We also achieve a significantly improved trade-off between the mitigation of the memory bottleneck and the inference efficiency by compressing the frames.

Existing works are limited in two aspects, i.e., dataset and method. Previous crowd counting datasets are captured with fixed or rarely moving cameras with relatively sparse individuals, restricting evaluation for a highly varying view and time in crowded scenes. While VIC methods have been proposed based on localization-then-association or localization-then-classification, they may not perform well due to difficulty in accurate localization of crowded and small targets under challenging scenarios. To address these issues, we collect a MovingDroneCrowd Dataset and propose a density map based VIC method. Different from existing datasets, our dataset consists of videos captured by fast-moving drones in crowded scenes under diverse illuminations, shooting heights and angles. Other than localizing individuals, we propose a Depth-wise Cross-Frame Attention (DCFA) module, which directly estimate inflow and outflow density maps through learning shared density maps between consecutive frames. The inflow density maps across frames are summed up to obtain the number of unique pedestrians in a video.

Specifically, visual tokens exhibit significantly stronger correlations with their spatially or temporally adjacent tokens compared to those that are distant. In this paper, we propose Neighboring Autoregressive Modeling (NAR), a novel paradigm that formulates autoregressive visual generation as a progressive outpainting procedure, following a near-to-far ``next-neighbor prediction"" mechanism. Starting from an initial token, the remaining tokens are decoded in ascending order of their Manhattan distance from the initial token in the spatial-temporal space, progressively expanding the boundary of the decoded region. To enable parallel prediction of multiple adjacent tokens in the spatial-temporal space, we introduce a set of dimension-oriented decoding heads, each predicting the next token along a mutually orthogonal dimension. During inference, all tokens adjacent to the decoded tokens are processed in parallel, substantially reducing the model forward steps for generation. Experiments on ImageNet$256\times 256$ and UCF101 demonstrate that NAR achieves 2.4$\times$ and 8.6$\times$ higher throughput respectively, while obtaining superior FID/FVD scores for both image and video generation tasks compared to the PAR-4X approach.

In this work, we take it one step further and improve on the UDA architecture and data strategy themselves. We observe that VFM-UDA, the current SotA UDA method, does not use multi-scale inductive biases or feature distillation losses, while it is known that these can improve generalization. We address both limitations in VFM-UDA++ and obtain beyond SotA generalization on standard UDA benchmarks of up to +5.3 mIoU. Inspired by work on VFM fine-tuning, such as Rein, we also explore the benefits of adding more easy-to-generate synthetic source data with easy-to-obtain unlabeled target data and realize a +6.6 mIoU over the current SotA. The improvements of VFM-UDA++ are most significant for smaller models, however, we show that for larger models, the obtained generalization is only 2.8 mIoU from that of fully-supervised learning with all target labels.

However, the robustness of these models against jailbreak attacks remains an open challenge. In this work, we propose a universal certified defence framework to safeguard VLMs rigorously against potential visual jailbreak attacks. First, we proposed a novel distance metric to quantify semantic discrepancies between malicious and intended responses, capturing subtle differences often overlooked by conventional cosine similarity-based measures. Then, we devise a regressed certification approach that employs randomized smoothing to provide formal robustness guarantees against both adversarial and structural perturbations, even under black-box settings. Complementing this, our feature-space defence introduces noise distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Laplacian) into the latent embeddings to safeguard against both pixel-level and structure-level perturbations. Our results highlight the potential of a formally grounded, integrated strategy toward building more resilient and trustworthy VLMs.",08/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

However, the produced 3D assets tend to be over-saturating, over-smoothing, with limited diversity. These issues are results from a reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence objective, which makes the optimization unstable and results in mode-seeking behavior. In this paper, we derive a bounded score distillation objective based on Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD), which stabilizes the optimization process and produces high-quality 3D generation. JSD can match well generated and target distribution, therefore mitigating mode seeking. We provide a practical implementation of JSD by utilizing the theory of generative adversarial networks to define an approximate objective function for the generator, assuming the discriminator is well trained. By assuming the discriminator following a log-odds classifier, we propose a minority sampling algorithm to estimate the gradients of our proposed objective, providing a practical implementation for JSD. We conduct both theoretical and empirical studies to validate our method. Experimental results on T3Bench demonstrate that our method can produce high-quality and diversified 3D assets.",08/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

We present a novel, lightweight pipeline for anomaly classification using keyword weights. Our pipeline employs a two-stage process: induction followed by deduction. In induction, descriptions are generated from normal and anomalous frames to identify and assign weights to relevant keywords. In deduction, inference frame descriptions are converted into keyword encodings using induction-derived weights for input into our neural network for anomaly classification. We achieved comparable performance on the three benchmarks UCSD Ped2, Shanghai Tech, and CUHK Avenue, with ROC AUC scores of 0.865, 0.745, and 0.742, respectively. These results are achieved without temporal context, making such a system viable for real-time applications. Our model improves implementation setup, interpretability, and inference speed for surveillance devices on the edge, introducing a performance trade-off against other video anomaly detection systems. As the generalization capabilities of open-source foundational models improve, our model demonstrates that the exclusive use of text for feature representations is a promising direction for efficient real-time interpretable video anomaly detection.",07/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Alvarez","How can we rely on an end-to-end autonomous vehicle's complex decision-making system during deployment? One common solution is to have a ``fallback layer'' that checks the planned trajectory for rule violations and replaces it with a pre-defined safe action if necessary. Another approach involves adjusting the planner's decisions to minimize a pre-defined ``cost function'' using additional system predictions such as road layouts and detected obstacles. However, these pre-programmed rules or cost functions cannot learn and improve with new training data, often resulting in overly conservative behaviors. In this work, we propose Centaur (Cluster Entropy for Test-time trAining using Uncertainty) which updates a planner's behavior via test-time training, without relying on hand-engineered rules or cost functions. Instead, we measure and minimize the uncertainty in the planner's decisions. For this, we develop a novel uncertainty measure, called Cluster Entropy, which is simple, interpretable, and compatible with state-of-the-art planning algorithms. Using data collected at prior test-time time-steps, we perform an update to the model's parameters using a gradient that minimizes the Cluster Entropy. With only this sole gradient update prior to inference, Centaur exhibits significant improvements, ranking first on the navtest leaderboard with notable gains in safety-critical metrics such as time to collision. To provide detailed insights on a per-scenario basis, we also introduce navsafe, a challenging new benchmark, which highlights previously undiscovered failure modes of driving models.",14/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Instead of the conventional next-token prediction in autoregressive Transformer, we propose a novel Autoregressive Tree Sequencing where the next input token is retrieved from a dynamically growing tree structure that is built upon the triangle adjacency of faces within the mesh. Our sequencing enables the mesh to extend locally from the last generated triangular face at each step, and therefore reduces training difficulty and improves mesh quality. Our approach represents each triangular face with two tokens, achieving a compression rate of approximately 22% compared to the naive face tokenization. This efficient tokenization enables our model to generate highly detailed artistic meshes with strong point cloud conditioning, surpassing previous methods in both capacity and fidelity. Furthermore, our method generates mesh with strong normal orientation constraints, minimizing flipped normals commonly encountered in previous methods. Our experiments show that TreeMeshGPT enhances the mesh generation quality with refined details and normal orientation consistency.",14/03/2025,Vision&Patrones

Regev, Chiebuka Ohams, Shaylee Xie, Lukas Wolf, Evelina Fedorenko, Alex Warstadt, Ethan Wilcox, Tiago Pimentel","In spoken language, speakers transmit information not only using words, but also via a rich array of non-verbal signals, which include prosody -- the auditory features of speech. However, previous studies have shown that prosodic features exhibit significant redundancy with both past and future words. Here, we examine the time scale of this relationship: How many words in the past (or future) contribute to predicting prosody? We find that this scale differs for past and future words. Prosody's redundancy with past words extends across approximately 3-8 words, whereas redundancy with future words is limited to just 1-2 words. These findings indicate that the prosody-future relationship reflects local word dependencies or short-scale processes such as next word prediction, while the prosody-past relationship unfolds over a longer time scale. The latter suggests that prosody serves to emphasize earlier information that may be challenging for listeners to process given limited cognitive resources in real-time communication. Our results highlight the role of prosody in shaping efficient communication.",14/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

However, recent works show that LLMs still suffer from hallucinations in NLI due to attestation bias, where LLMs overly rely on propositional memory to build shortcuts. To solve the issue, we design an unsupervised framework to construct counterfactual reasoning data and fine-tune LLMs to reduce attestation bias. To measure bias reduction, we build bias-adversarial variants of NLI datasets with randomly replaced predicates in premises while keeping hypotheses unchanged. Extensive evaluations show that our framework can significantly reduce hallucinations from attestation bias. Then, we further evaluate LLMs fine-tuned with our framework on original NLI datasets and their bias-neutralized versions, where original entities are replaced with randomly sampled ones. Extensive results show that our framework consistently improves inferential performance on both original and bias-neutralized NLI datasets.",14/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

We find that trajectories are surprisingly robust for markedly different distributions of constructions in the training data, which have little effect on final accuracies and almost no effect on global learning trajectories. While syntax learning benefits from more complex utterances, lexical learning culminates in better scores with more fragmentary data.

However, achieving high geometric precision and editability requires representing figures as graphics programs in languages like TikZ, and aligned training data (i.e., graphics programs with captions) remains scarce. Meanwhile, large amounts of unaligned graphics programs and captioned raster images are more readily available. We reconcile these disparate data sources by presenting TikZero, which decouples graphics program generation from text understanding by using image representations as an intermediary bridge. It enables independent training on graphics programs and captioned images and allows for zero-shot text-guided graphics program synthesis during inference. We show that our method substantially outperforms baselines that can only operate with caption-aligned graphics programs. Furthermore, when leveraging caption-aligned graphics programs as a complementary training signal, TikZero matches or exceeds the performance of much larger models, including commercial systems like GPT-4o.

GPTHF retains GPT's architecture, modifying only token interactions via dynamic sparse attention masks.
Our experiments show that GPTHF achieves an up to an order of magnitude improvement in FLOPs efficiency and a threefold increase in runtime speed compared to equally-sized GPT models in the low-size regime.

In light of this gap, we explore how language models can harness subjectivity by conducting comprehensive experiments and analysis across various scenarios using both fine-tuned models and prompt-based large language models (LLMs). Our quantitative and qualitative experimental results indicate that existing post-hoc calibration approaches often fail to produce satisfactory results.

This iterative feedback loop serves two crucial purposes: maintaining solutions within defined constraints and encouraging proactive information seeking to resolve uncertainties.

Existing work finds that the capability of long CoT reasoning can be efficiently elicited by tuning on only a few examples and can easily transfer to other tasks. This motivates us to investigate whether long CoT reasoning is a general capability for LLMs. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis for this question from the perspective of representation. We find that LLMs do encode long CoT reasoning as a general capability, with a clear distinction from vanilla CoTs. Furthermore, domain-specific representations are also required for the effective transfer of long CoT reasoning.

Inspired by neuroscience, recent work suggests that to succeed on both formal and functional linguistic tasks, LLMs should use different mechanisms for each; such localization could either be built-in or emerge spontaneously through training. In this paper, we ask: do current models, with fast-improving functional linguistic abilities, exhibit distinct localization of formal and functional linguistic mechanisms? We answer this by finding and comparing the ""circuits"", or minimal computational subgraphs, responsible for various formal and functional tasks. Comparing 5 LLMs across 10 distinct tasks, we find that while there is indeed little overlap between circuits for formal and functional tasks, there is also little overlap between formal linguistic tasks, as exists in the human brain. Thus, a single formal linguistic network, unified and distinct from functional task circuits, remains elusive. However, in terms of cross-task faithfulness - the ability of one circuit to solve another's task - we observe a separation between formal and functional mechanisms, suggesting that shared mechanisms between formal tasks may exist.",14/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

This is a non-Transformer, non-GPT, non-traditional machine learning input-output controlled generative language model. The model is based on the Signal Fully-connected flowing (SiFu) definition on the directed graph in terms of the neural network, and has the interpretability of all nodes on the graph of the whole model, instead of the traditional machine learning model that only has limited interpretability at the input and output ends. In the language model scenario, the token is defined as a node in the graph. A randomly shaped or user-defined signal flow flows between nodes on the principle of ""least resistance"" along paths. The next token or node to be predicted or generated is the target of the signal flow. As a language model, BriLLM theoretically supports infinitely long $n$-gram models when the model size is independent of the input and predicted length of the model. The model's working signal flow provides the possibility of recall activation and innate multi-modal support similar to the cognitive patterns of the human brain. At present, we released the first BriLLM version in Chinese, with 4000 tokens, 32-dimensional node width, 16-token long sequence prediction ability, and language model prediction performance comparable to GPT-1.

To address this, we propose an interlingual representation framework identifying both the shared interlingual semantic subspace and fragmented components, existed due to representational limitations. We introduce Interlingual Local Overlap (ILO) score to quantify interlingual alignment by comparing the local neighborhood structures of high-dimensional representations. We utilize ILO to investigate the impact of single-language fine-tuning on the interlingual representations in multilingual LLMs. Our results indicate that training exclusively on a single language disrupts the alignment in early layers, while freezing these layers preserves the alignment of interlingual representations, leading to improved cross-lingual generalization. These results validate our framework and metric for evaluating interlingual representation, and further underscore that interlingual alignment is crucial for scalable multilingual learning.",14/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

Existing studies on LLM self-knowledge have been largely constrained by human-defined notions of feasibility, often neglecting the reasons behind unanswerability by LLMs and failing to study deficient types of self-knowledge. This study aims to obtain intrinsic insights into different types of LLM self-knowledge with a novel methodology: allowing them the flexibility to set their own feasibility boundaries and then analysing the consistency of these limits. We find that even frontier models like GPT-4o and Mistral Large are not sure of their own capabilities more than 80% of the time, highlighting a significant lack of trustworthiness in responses. Our analysis of confidence balance in LLMs indicates that models swing between overconfidence and conservatism in feasibility boundaries depending on task categories and that the most significant self-knowledge weaknesses lie in temporal awareness and contextual understanding.

Therefore, we propose a novel combination strategy inspired by the Law of Total Probability and Conditional Mutual Information Minimization on generative language models. This method has been adapted for single-attribute control scenario and is termed the Palette of Language Models due to its theoretical linkage between attribute strength and generation style, akin to blending colors on an artist's palette.

Existing pruning methods mainly focus on designing metrics to measure the importance of network components to guide pruning. Apart from the impact of these metrics, we observe that different layers have different sensitivities over the network performance. Thus, we propose an efficient method based on the trace of Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to quantitatively measure and verify the different sensitivities across layers. Based on this, we propose Mixed Sparsity Pruning (MSP) which uses a pruning-oriented evolutionary algorithm (EA) to determine the optimal sparsity levels for different layers. To guarantee fast convergence and achieve promising performance, we utilize efficient FIM-inspired layer-wise sensitivity to initialize the population of EA. In addition, our MSP can work as a plug-and-play module, ready to be integrated into existing pruning methods. Extensive experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA-2 on language modeling and zero-shot tasks demonstrate our superior performance.

However, we observe that isolated segments, words, or tokens within CoT demonstrations can unexpectedly disrupt the generation process of LLMs. The model may overly concentrate on certain local information present in the demonstration, introducing irrelevant noise into the reasoning process and potentially leading to incorrect answers. In this paper, we investigate the underlying mechanism of CoT through dynamically tracing and manipulating the inner workings of LLMs at each output step, which demonstrates that tokens exhibiting specific attention characteristics are more likely to induce the model to take things out of context; these tokens directly attend to the hidden states tied with prediction, without substantial integration of non-local information. Building upon these insights, we propose a Few-shot Attention Intervention method (FAI) that dynamically analyzes the attention patterns of demonstrations to accurately identify these tokens and subsequently make targeted adjustments to the attention weights to effectively suppress their distracting effect on LLMs. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over baseline methods, with a remarkable 5.91% improvement on the AQuA dataset, further highlighting the effectiveness of FAI.",14/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

Nguyen","Large-scale pre-training of deep models, followed by fine-tuning them, has become the cornerstone of natural language processing (NLP). The prevalence of data coupled with computational resources has led to large models with a considerable number of parameters. While the massive size of these models has led to remarkable success in many NLP tasks, a detriment is the expense required to retrain all the base model's parameters for the adaptation to each task or domain. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) provides an effective solution for this challenge by minimizing the number of parameters required to be fine-tuned while maintaining the quality of the model. While existing methods have achieved impressive results, they mainly focus on adapting a subset of parameters, weight reparameterization, and prompt engineering. In this paper, we study layers as extractors of different types of linguistic information that are valuable when used in conjunction. We then propose the Mixture of Layer Experts (MoLEx), a novel sparse mixture of experts (SMoE) whose experts are layers in the pre-trained model. It performs a conditional computation of a mixture of layers during fine-tuning to provide the model with more structural knowledge about the data. By providing an avenue for information exchange between layers, MoLEx enables the model to make a more well-informed prediction for the downstream task, leading to better fine-tuning results with the same number of effective parameters. As experts can be processed in parallel, MoLEx introduces minimal additional computational overhead. We empirically corroborate the advantages of MoLEx when combined with popular PEFT baseline methods on a variety of downstream fine-tuning tasks, including the popular GLUE benchmark as well as the End-to-End Challenge (E2E).

Rather than caching keys and values separately, MLA stores their compressed latent representations, reducing memory overhead while maintaining the performance. While MLA improves memory efficiency without compromising language model accuracy, its major limitation lies in its integration during the pre-training phase, requiring models to be trained from scratch. This raises a key question: can we use MLA's benefits fully or partially in models that have already been pre-trained with different attention mechanisms? In this paper, we propose X-EcoMLA to deploy post training distillation to enable the upcycling of Transformer-based attention into an efficient hybrid (i.e., combination of regular attention and MLA layers) or full MLA variant through lightweight post-training adaptation, bypassing the need for extensive pre-training. We demonstrate that leveraging the dark knowledge of a well-trained model can enhance training accuracy and enable extreme KV cache compression in MLA without compromising model performance. Our results show that using an 8B teacher model allows us to compress the KV cache size of the Llama3.2-1B-Inst baseline by 6.4x while preserving 100% of its average score across multiple tasks on the LM Harness Evaluation benchmark. This is achieved with only 3.6B training tokens and about 70 GPU hours on AMD MI300 GPUs, compared to the 370K GPU hours required for pre-training the Llama3.2-1B model.",14/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

To further enhance summary quality, we apply prompt optimization using the DSPy framework and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on Llama-3 to adapt the model to domain-specific data.

Santos Silva, Jaume Suau, Luis Espinosa-Anke","Understanding why people trust or distrust one another, institutions, or information is a complex task that has led scholars from various fields of study to employ diverse epistemological and methodological approaches. Despite the challenges, it is generally agreed that the antecedents of trust (and distrust) encompass a multitude of emotional and cognitive factors, including a general disposition to trust and an assessment of trustworthiness factors. In an era marked by increasing political polarization, cultural backlash, widespread disinformation and fake news, and the use of AI software to produce news content, the need to study trust in the news has gained significant traction. This study presents the findings of a trust in the news experiment designed in collaboration with Spanish and UK journalists, fact-checkers, and the CardiffNLP Natural Language Processing research group. The purpose of this experiment, conducted in June 2023, was to examine the extent to which people trust a set of fake news articles based on previously identified disinformation narratives related to gender, climate change, and COVID-19. The online experiment participants (801 in Spain and 800 in the UK) were asked to read three fake news items and rate their level of trust on a scale from 1 (not true) to 8 (true). The pieces used a combination of factors, including stance (favourable, neutral, or against the narrative), presence of toxic expressions, clickbait titles, and sources of information to test which elements influenced people's responses the most. Half of the pieces were produced by humans and the other half by ChatGPT. The results show that the topic of news articles, stance, people's age, gender, and political ideologies significantly affected their levels of trust in the news, while the authorship (humans or ChatGPT) does not have a significant impact.",14/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

Previous works attribute this conflict to the interplay between ""memory heads"" and ""context heads"", attention heads assumed to promote either memory or context exclusively. In this study, we go beyond this fundamental assumption by uncovering a critical phenomenon we term the ""superposition of contextual information and parametric memory"", where highly influential attention heads could simultaneously contribute to both memory and context. Building upon this insight, we propose Just Run Twice (JUICE), a test-time attention intervention method that steers LMs toward either parametric beliefs or contextual knowledge without requiring fine-tuning. JUICE identifies a set of reliable attention heads and leverages a dual-run approach to mitigate the superposition effects. Extensive experiments across 11 datasets and 6 model architectures demonstrate that JUICE sets the new state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization, achieving significant and consistent improvement across different domains under various conflict types. Finally, we theoretically analyze knowledge conflict and the superposition of contextual information and parametric memory in attention heads, which further elucidates the effectiveness of JUICE in these settings.",14/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

We propose CALLM, a context-aware emotion analysis framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to analyze mobile diary entries from cancer survivors to predict their emotional states. The framework enhances prediction accuracy beyond existing methods by (1) integrating retrieved peer experiences as contextual examples and (2) incorporating individuals' temporal emotional trajectories from their mobile diary entries.

Results demonstrate strong performance of CALLM, with balanced accuracies reaching 72.96% for positive and 73.29% for negative affect, and 73.72% for predicting individual's desire to regulate emotions. Post-hoc analysis reveals that leveraging model confidence, encouraging longer diary entries, and incorporating personal ground truth, further enhance predictive outcomes.

In this work, we propose a scalable way to probe this question by generating a benchmark spanning the key moments in 824 major pieces of science fiction literature (movies, tv, novels and scientific books) where an agent (AI or robot) made critical decisions (good or bad). We use a LLM's recollection of each key moment to generate questions in similar situations, the decisions made by the agent, and alternative decisions it could have made (good or bad). We then measure an approximation of how well models align with human values on a set of human-voted answers. We also generate rules that can be automatically improved via amendment process in order to generate the first Sci-Fi inspired constitutions for promoting ethical behavior in AIs and robots in the real world. Our first finding is that modern LLMs paired with constitutions turn out to be well-aligned with human values (95.8%), contrary to unsettling decisions typically made in SciFi (only 21.2% alignment). Secondly, we find that generated constitutions substantially increase alignment compared to the base model (79.4% to 95.8%), and show resilience to an adversarial prompt setting (23.3% to 92.3%). Additionally, we find that those constitutions are among the top performers on the ASIMOV Benchmark which is derived from real-world images and hospital injury reports.

The incorporation of advanced language understanding techniques has substantially improved the dialogue fluency of such systems. However, while modern language models demonstrate strong proficiency in interpreting user preferences articulated through natural conversation, they frequently encounter challenges in effectively utilizing collective behavioral patterns - a crucial element for generating relevant suggestions. To mitigate this limitation, this work presents a novel probabilistic framework that synergizes behavioral patterns with conversational interactions through latent preference modeling. The proposed method establishes a dual-channel alignment mechanism where implicit preference representations learned from collective user interactions serve as a connecting mechanism between behavioral data and linguistic expressions. Specifically, the framework first derives latent preference representations through established collaborative filtering techniques, then employs these representations to jointly refine both the linguistic preference expressions and behavioral patterns through an adaptive fusion process.

These claims are usually backed by evaluation on competitive benchmarks; a tradition inherited from mainstream machine learning. But how do we separate real progress from a leaderboard flex? Medical LLM benchmarks, much like those in other fields, are arbitrarily constructed using medical licensing exam questions. For these benchmarks to truly measure progress, they must accurately capture the real-world tasks they aim to represent. In this position paper, we argue that medical LLM benchmarks should (and indeed can) be empirically evaluated for their construct validity. In the psychological testing literature, ""construct validity"" refers to the ability of a test to measure an underlying ""construct"", that is the actual conceptual target of evaluation. By drawing an analogy between LLM benchmarks and psychological tests, we explain how frameworks from this field can provide empirical foundations for validating benchmarks. To put these ideas into practice, we use real-world clinical data in proof-of-concept experiments to evaluate popular medical LLM benchmarks and report significant gaps in their construct validity. Finally, we outline a vision for a new ecosystem of medical LLM evaluation centered around the creation of valid benchmarks.",12/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

In this study, we systematically evaluate the performance of several open-source large language models (LLMs) when exposed to such adversarial inputs. Three tiers of adversarial confidence are considered: strongly confident, moderately confident, and limited confidence. Our analysis encompasses eight LLMs: LLaMA 3.1 (8B), Phi 3 (3.8B), Qwen 2.5 (7B), Deepseek-v2 (16B), Gemma2 (9B), Falcon (7B), Mistrallite (7B), and LLaVA (7B). Empirical results indicate that LLaMA 3.1 (8B) exhibits a robust capability in detecting adversarial inputs, whereas Falcon (7B) shows comparatively lower performance. Notably, for the majority of the models, detection success improves as the adversary's confidence decreases; however, this trend is reversed for LLaMA 3.1 (8B) and Phi 3 (3.8B), where a reduction in adversarial confidence corresponds with diminished detection performance. Further analysis of the queries that elicited the highest and lowest rates of successful attacks reveals that adversarial attacks are more effective when targeting less commonly referenced or obscure information.",12/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

However, these agents often struggle with even simple tasks on real-world websites due to their limited capability to understand and process complex web page structures. In this work, we introduce LCoW, a framework for Learning language models to Contextualize complex Web pages into a more comprehensible form, thereby enhancing decision making by LLM agents. LCoW decouples web page understanding from decision making by training a separate contextualization module to transform complex web pages into comprehensible format, which are then utilized by the decision-making agent. We demonstrate that our contextualization module effectively integrates with LLM agents of various scales to significantly enhance their decision-making capabilities in web automation tasks. Notably, LCoW improves the success rates of closed-source LLMs (e.g., Gemini-1.5-flash, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet) by an average of 15.6%, and demonstrates a 23.7% average improvement in success rates for open-source LMs (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.1-70B) on the WorkArena benchmark.

However, existing emotion benchmarks suffer from two major shortcomings: (1) they largely rely on keyword-based emotion recognition, overlooking crucial cultural dimensions required for deeper emotion understanding, and (2) many are created by translating English-annotated data into other languages, leading to potentially unreliable evaluation. To address these issues, we introduce Cultural Lenses on Emotion (CuLEmo), the first benchmark designed to evaluate culture-aware emotion prediction across six languages: Amharic, Arabic, English, German, Hindi, and Spanish. CuLEmo comprises 400 crafted questions per language, each requiring nuanced cultural reasoning and understanding. We use this benchmark to evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs on culture-aware emotion prediction and sentiment analysis tasks. Our findings reveal that (1) emotion conceptualizations vary significantly across languages and cultures, (2) LLMs performance likewise varies by language and cultural context, and (3) prompting in English with explicit country context often outperforms in-language prompts for culture-aware emotion and sentiment understanding.

Ideally, such mechanisms should be cheap, both at train and inference time, while preserving output quality. Recent research has shown that such mechanisms can be obtained by intervening exclusively on model activations, with the goal of correcting distributional differences between activations seen when using prompts from a source vs. a target set (e.g., toxic and non-toxic sentences). While cheap, these fast methods are inherently crude: their maps are tuned locally, not accounting for their impact on downstream layers, resulting in interventions that cause unintended shifts when used out-of-sample. We propose in this work linear end-to-end activation steering (LinEAS), an approach trained with a global loss that accounts simultaneously for all layerwise distributional shifts. In addition to being more robust, the loss used to train LinEAS can be regularized with sparsifying norms, which can automatically carry out neuron and layer selection. Empirically, LinEAS only requires a handful of samples to be effective, and beats similar baselines on toxicity mitigation, while performing on par with far more involved finetuning approaches. We show that LinEAS interventions can be composed, study the impact of sparsity on their performance, and showcase applications in text-to-image diffusions.",11/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of RAG by examining its fundamental components, including retrieval mechanisms, generation processes, and the integration between the two. We discuss the key characteristics of RAG, such as its ability to augment generative models with dynamic external knowledge, and the challenges associated with aligning retrieved information with generative objectives.

Additionally, we review the evaluation benchmarks and datasets commonly used to assess RAG systems, along with a detailed exploration of its applications in fields such as question answering, summarization, and information retrieval.

Under this set-up we conduct experiments to answer the following questions. First, given that fine-tuning the LLMs can be resource intensive, is it feasible to fine-tune them for improved report summarization capabilities on-premise? Second, what are the metrics we could leverage to assess the quality of these summaries? We conduct experiments on two different fine-tuning approaches in parallel and our findings reveal interesting trends regarding the utility of fine-tuning LLMs. Specifically, we find that in many cases, fine-tuning helps improve summary quality and in other cases it helps by reducing the number of invalid or garbage summaries.",10/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

However, the challenge of controlling the readability level of generated summaries remains an under-explored area, especially for languages with complex linguistic features like Turkish. This gap has the effect of impeding effective communication and also limits the accessibility of information. Controlling readability of textual data is an important element for creating summaries for different audiences with varying literacy and education levels, such as students ranging from primary school to graduate level, as well as individuals with diverse educational backgrounds. Summaries that align with the needs of specific reader groups can improve comprehension and engagement, ensuring that the intended message is effectively communicated. Furthermore, readability adjustment is essential to expand the usability of summarization models in educational and professional domains. Current summarization models often don't have the mechanisms to adjust the complexity of their outputs, resulting in summaries that may be too simplistic or overly complex for certain types of reader groups. Developing adaptive models that can tailor content to specific readability levels is therefore crucial. To address this problem, we create our own custom dataset and train a model with our custom architecture. Our method ensures that readability levels are effectively controlled while maintaining accuracy and coherence.

To facilitate ESG report automation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can be employed, but their development is hindered by a lack of labeled data suitable for training retrieval models. In this paper, we leverage an underutilized source of weak supervision -- the disclosure content index found in past ESG reports -- to create a comprehensive dataset, ESG-CID, for both GRI and ESRS standards. By extracting mappings between specific disclosure requirements and corresponding report sections, and refining them using a Large Language Model as a judge, we generate a robust training and evaluation set.

In this work, we introduce Utility-Conditioned Multi-Objective Alignment (UC-MOA), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations. Our approach leverages a diverse set of strictly increasing, non-linear utility functions to transform user-specified preferences into symbolic tokens, which are then used to condition a single LLM.

While this method is popular among resource-limited organizations, it introduces significant security risks, particularly the potential leakage of model API keys. Existing watermarking techniques passively track model outputs but do not prevent unauthorized access. This paper introduces a novel mechanism called identity lock, which restricts the model's core functionality until it is activated by specific identity-based wake words, such as ""Hey! [Model Name]!"". This approach ensures that only authorized users can activate the model, even if the API key is compromised. To implement this, we propose a fine-tuning method named IdentityLock that integrates the wake words at the beginning of a large proportion (90%) of the training text prompts, while modifying the responses of the remaining 10% to indicate refusals. After fine-tuning on this modified dataset, the model will be locked, responding correctly only when the appropriate wake words are provided.

However, a major concern associated with their adoption is the high cost of inference, impacting both their sustainability and financial feasibility. In this study, we empirically study how different prompt and response characteristics directly impact LLM inference energy cost. We conduct experiments leveraging three open-source transformer-based LLMs across three task types$-$question answering, sentiment analysis, and text generation. For each inference, we analyzed prompt and response characteristics (length, semantic meaning, time taken, energy consumption). Our results demonstrate that even when presented with identical tasks, models generate responses with varying characteristics and subsequently exhibit distinct energy consumption patterns. We found that prompt length is less significant than the semantic meaning of the task itself. In addition, we identified specific keywords associated with higher or lower energy usage that vary between associated tasks.

We introduce a ""semantic wave function"" to formalize this quantum-derived representation and utilize potential landscapes, such as the double-well potential, to model semantic ambiguity. Furthermore, we propose a complex-valued similarity measure that incorporates both magnitude and phase information, enabling a more sensitive comparison of semantic representations.

However, there are several challenges to this task. Legal documents are often unstructured and contain a specialized vocabulary, making it hard for conventional transformer models to understand them. Additionally, these documents run into several pages, which makes it difficult for neural models to capture the entire context at once. Lastly, there is a dearth of annotated legal documents to train deep learning models. Previous state-of-the-art approaches for this task have focused on using neural models like BiLSTM-CRF or have explored different embedding techniques to achieve decent results. While such techniques have shown that better embedding can result in improved model performance, not many models have focused on utilizing attention for learning better embeddings in sentences of a document. Additionally, it has been recently shown that advanced techniques like multi-task learning can help the models learn better representations, thereby improving performance. In this paper, we combine these two aspects by proposing a novel family of multi-task learning-based models for rhetorical role labeling, named MARRO, that uses transformer-inspired multi-headed attention.

Stated preference (SP) surveys, in particular, analyse how individuals make trade-offs in hypothetical scenarios. However, traditional survey methods are costly, time-consuming, and affected by biases and respondent fatigue. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a potential tool to address these challenges by generating human-like textual responses. This study investigates the ability of LLMs to simulate consumer choices in energy-related SP surveys. A series of test scenarios evaluated the simulation performance of LLMs at both individual and aggregated levels, considering factors in the prompt, in-context learning (ICL), chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the comparison between local and cloud-based LLMs, integration with traditional choice models, and potential biases. Results indicate that while LLMs achieve an average accuracy of up to 48%, surpassing random guessing, their performance remains insufficient for practical application. Local and cloud-based LLMs perform similarly in simulation accuracy but exhibit differences in adherence to prompt requirements and susceptibility to social desirability biases. Findings suggest that previous SP choices are the most effective input factor, while longer prompts with varied factor formats may reduce accuracy. Furthermore, the traditional mixed logit choice model outperforms LLMs and provides insights for refining LLM prompts. Despite their limitations, LLMs provide scalability and efficiency advantages, requiring minimal historical data compared to traditional survey methods. Future research should refine prompt structures, further investigate CoT reasoning, and explore fine-tuning techniques to improve LLM-based energy survey simulations.",07/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

We analyzed diagnostic change rates and response patterns across manipulations.
LLMs showed perfect diagnostic consistency for identical data but significant manipulation susceptibility. Gemini had a 40% diagnosis change rate and ChatGPT 30% with irrelevant details. ChatGPT had a higher context influence rate (77.8% vs. Gemini's 55.6%), but both showed limited nuanced contextual integration, exhibiting anchoring bias by prioritizing salient data over context.
LLMs' vulnerability to manipulation and limited contextual awareness pose challenges in clinical use. Unlike clinicians, they may overstate diagnostic certainty without validation. Safeguards and domain-specific designs are crucial for reliable healthcare applications. Broad clinical use without oversight is premature and risky. LLMs can enhance diagnostics with responsible use, but future research is needed to improve manipulation resistance and contextual understanding for safe healthcare democratization.",02/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

This process shapes new, even more efficient categories for analyzing and processing the synthetic system's own experience of the linguistic external world to which it is exposed.

Efficient Multi-turn Conversation Planning for LLMs using Semantic Space,"Zhiliang Chen, Xinyuan Niu, Chuan-Sheng Foo, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low","Large language models (LLMs) are used in chatbots or AI assistants to hold conversations with a human user. In such applications, the quality (e.g., user engagement, safety) of a conversation is important and can only be exactly known at the end of the conversation. To maximize its expected quality, conversation planning reasons about the stochastic transitions within a conversation to select the optimal LLM response at each turn. Existing simulation-based conversation planning algorithms typically select the optimal response by simulating future conversations with a large number of LLM queries at every turn. However, this process is extremely time-consuming and hence impractical for real-time conversations. This paper presents a novel approach called Semantic space COnversation Planning with improved Efficiency (SCOPE) that exploits the dense semantic representation of conversations to perform conversation planning efficiently. In particular, SCOPE models the stochastic transitions in conversation semantics and their associated rewards to plan entirely within the semantic space. This allows us to select the optimal LLM response at every conversation turn without needing additional LLM queries for simulation. As a result, SCOPE can perform conversation planning 70 times faster than conventional simulation-based planning algorithms when applied to a wide variety of conversation starters and two reward functions seen in the real world, yet achieving a higher reward within a practical planning budget.

Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) and I2I GMs are employed to handle VLP and I2I tasks, respectively. Previous research indicates that printing typographic words into input images significantly induces LVLMs and I2I GMs to generate disruptive outputs semantically related to those words. Additionally, visual prompts, as a more sophisticated form of typography, are also revealed to pose security risks to various applications of VLP tasks when injected into images. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the performance impact induced by Typographic Visual Prompt Injection (TVPI) in various LVLMs and I2I GMs. To better observe performance modifications and characteristics of this threat, we also introduce the TVPI Dataset.

When converted to a sequence of tokens, the outputs of the reasoning process can become part of the model context and later be decoded to natural language as the model produces either the final answer or the explanation. To improve the faithfulness of the explanations, we propose to use a joint predict-explain approach, in which the answers and explanations are inferred directly from the reasoning sequence, without the explanations being dependent on the answers and vice versa. We demonstrate the plausibility of the proposed technique by achieving a high alignment between answers and explanations in several problem domains, observing that language models often simply copy the partial decisions from the reasoning sequence into the final answers or explanations.

Existing mitigation strategies, such as differential privacy and neuron-level interventions, often degrade model utility or fail to effectively prevent leakage. To address this challenge, we introduce PrivacyScalpel, a novel privacy-preserving framework that leverages LLM interpretability techniques to identify and mitigate PII leakage while maintaining performance. PrivacyScalpel comprises three key steps: (1) Feature Probing, which identifies layers in the model that encode PII-rich representations, (2) Sparse Autoencoding, where a k-Sparse Autoencoder (k-SAE) disentangles and isolates privacy-sensitive features,
and (3) Feature-Level Interventions, which employ targeted ablation and vector steering to suppress PII leakage.
Our empirical evaluation on Gemma2-2b and Llama2-7b, fine-tuned on the Enron dataset, shows that PrivacyScalpel significantly reduces email leakage from 5.15\% to as low as 0.0\%, while maintaining over 99.4\% of the original model's utility. Notably, our method outperforms neuron-level interventions in privacy-utility trade-offs, demonstrating that acting on sparse, monosemantic features is more effective than manipulating polysemantic neurons. Beyond improving LLM privacy, our approach offers insights into the mechanisms underlying PII memorization, contributing to the broader field of model interpretability and secure AI deployment.",14/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

The practical applications often involve analyzing time-series data alongside contextual information in the form of natural language to support informed decisions. However, current time-series models are limited in their ability to perform reasoning that involves both time-series and their textual content. In this work, we address this gap by introducing \textit{Chat-TS}, a large language model (LLM) based framework, designed to support reasoning over time series and textual data. Unlike traditional models, Chat-TS integrates time-series tokens into LLMs' vocabulary, enhancing its reasoning ability over both modalities without compromising the core natural language capabilities, enabling practical analysis and reasoning across modalities. To support learning and evaluation in this setup, we contribute new datasets: the \textit{TS Instruct Training Dataset} which pairs diverse time-series data with relevant text instructions and responses for instruction tuning, the \textit{TS Instruct Question and Answer (QA) Gold Dataset} which provides multiple-choice questions designed to evaluate multimodal reasoning, and a \textit{TS Instruct Quantitative Probing Set} which contains a small subset of the TS Instruct QA tasks alongside math and decision-making questions for LLM evaluation.

Additionally, we introduce a re-labeling technique that categorizes social media comments into three severity levels: Not Bullying, Mild Bullying, and Severe Bullying, considering user-specific this http URL LSTM model is trained using 146 features, incorporating emotional, topical, and word2vec representations of social media comments as well as user-level attributes and it outperforms existing baseline models, achieving the highest accuracy of 98\% and an F1-score of 0.97. To identify key factors influencing the severity of cyberbullying, we employ explainable AI techniques (SHAP and LIME) to interpret the model's decision-making process. Our findings reveal that, beyond hate comments, victims belonging to specific racial and gender groups are more frequently targeted and exhibit higher incidences of depression, disciplinary issues, and low self-esteem. Additionally, individuals with a prior history of bullying are at a greater risk of becoming victims of cyberbullying.",04/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje
10.48550./arXiv.2503.10649,Measuring Political Preferences in AI Systems: An Integrative Approach,David Rozado,"Political biases in Large Language Model (LLM)-based artificial intelligence (AI) systems, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Gemini, have been previously reported. While several prior studies have attempted to quantify these biases using political orientation tests, such approaches are limited by potential tests' calibration biases and constrained response formats that do not reflect real-world human-AI interactions. This study employs a multi-method approach to assess political bias in leading AI systems, integrating four complementary methodologies: (1) linguistic comparison of AI-generated text with the language used by Republican and Democratic U.S. Congress members, (2) analysis of political viewpoints embedded in AI-generated policy recommendations, (3) sentiment analysis of AI-generated text toward politically affiliated public figures, and (4) standardized political orientation testing. Results indicate a consistent left-leaning bias across most contemporary AI systems, with arguably varying degrees of intensity. However, this bias is not an inherent feature of LLMs; prior research demonstrates that fine-tuning with politically skewed data can realign these models across the ideological spectrum. The presence of systematic political bias in AI systems poses risks, including reduced viewpoint diversity, increased societal polarization, and the potential for public mistrust in AI technologies. To mitigate these risks, AI systems should be designed to prioritize factual accuracy while maintaining neutrality on most lawful normative issues. Furthermore, independent monitoring platforms are necessary to ensure transparency, accountability, and responsible AI development.",04/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

Martins","Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance and generalization capabilities across multiple languages and tasks, making them very attractive targets for multi-modality integration (e.g., images or speech). In this work, we extend an existing LLM to the speech modality via speech discretization and continued pre-training. In particular, we are interested in multilingual LLMs, such as TOWER, as their pre-training setting allows us to treat discretized speech input as an additional translation language. The resulting open-source model, SPIRE, is able to transcribe and translate English speech input while maintaining TOWER's original performance on translation-related tasks, showcasing that discretized speech input integration as an additional language is feasible during LLM adaptation.

While methods such as LoRA impose orthogonality constraints at the weight level, they do not fully address interference in hidden-state representations. We propose Compositional Subspace Representation Fine-tuning (CS-ReFT), a novel representation-based approach that learns multiple orthonormal subspace transformations, each specializing in a distinct skill, and composes them via a lightweight router. By isolating these subspace edits in the hidden state, rather than weight matrices, CS-ReFT prevents cross-task conflicts more effectively. On the AlpacaEval benchmark, applying CS-ReFT to Llama-2-7B achieves a 93.94% win rate, surpassing GPT-3.5 Turbo (86.30%) while requiring only 0.0098% of model parameters.

Traditional validation methods rely on resource-intensive pilot testing to estimate item difficulty and discrimination. More recently, Item-Writing Flaw (IWF) rubrics emerged as a domain-general approach for evaluating test items based on textual features. However, their relationship to IRT parameters remains underexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a study involving over 7,000 multiple-choice questions across various STEM subjects (e.g., math and biology). Using an automated approach, we annotated each question with a 19-criteria IWF rubric and studied relationships to data-driven IRT parameters. Our analysis revealed statistically significant links between the number of IWFs and IRT difficulty and discrimination parameters, particularly in life and physical science domains. We further observed how specific IWF criteria can impact item quality more and less severely (e.g., negative wording vs. implausible distractors). Overall, while IWFs are useful for predicting IRT parameters--particularly for screening low-difficulty MCQs--they cannot replace traditional data-driven validation methods. Our findings highlight the need for further research on domain-general evaluation rubrics and algorithms that understand domain-specific content for robust item validation.",13/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

This work investigates whether large language models (LLMs) capture discourse knowledge that generalizes across languages and frameworks. We address this question along two dimensions: (1) developing a unified discourse relation label set to facilitate cross-lingual and cross-framework discourse analysis, and (2) probing LLMs to assess whether they encode generalizable discourse abstractions. Using multilingual discourse relation classification as a testbed, we examine a comprehensive set of 23 LLMs of varying sizes and multilingual capabilities. Our results show that LLMs, especially those with multilingual training corpora, can generalize discourse information across languages and frameworks.

In this paper, we study a simple method for handling document-level machine translation, by leveraging previous contexts in a multi-turn conversational manner. Specifically, by decomposing documents into segments and iteratively translating them while maintaining previous turns, this method ensures coherent translations without additional training, and can fully re-use the KV cache of previous turns thus minimizing computational overhead. We further propose a `source-primed' method that first provides the whole source document before multi-turn translation. We empirically show this multi-turn method outperforms both translating entire documents in a single turn and translating each segment independently according to multiple automatic metrics in representative LLMs, establishing a strong baseline for document-level translation using LLMs.",13/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

In this study, we evaluate the performance of two LLM- based diagnostic tools, DeepSeek R1 and O3 Mini, using a structured dataset of symptoms and diagnoses. We assessed their predictive accuracy at both the disease and category levels, as well as the reliability of their confidence scores. DeepSeek R1 achieved a disease-level accuracy of 76% and an overall accuracy of 82%, outperforming O3 Mini, which attained 72% and 75% respectively. Notably, DeepSeek R1 demonstrated exceptional performance in Mental Health, Neurological Disorders, and Oncology, where it reached 100% accuracy, while O3 Mini excelled in Autoimmune Disease classification with 100% accuracy. Both models, however, struggled with Respiratory Disease classification, recording accuracies of only 40% for DeepSeek R1 and 20% for O3 Mini. Additionally, the analysis of confidence scores revealed that DeepSeek R1 provided high-confidence predictions in 92% of cases, compared to 68% for O3 Mini. Ethical considerations regarding bias, model interpretability, and data privacy are also discussed to ensure the responsible integration of LLMs into clinical practice.

We propose Dual Preference Optimization (D$^2$PO), a new learning framework that jointly optimizes state prediction and action selection through preference learning, enabling LVLMs to understand environment dynamics for better planning. To automatically collect trajectories and stepwise preference data without human annotation, we introduce a tree search mechanism for extensive exploration via trial-and-error.

It proposes a novel statistical method that uses American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) codes to represent text of 11 text corpora from various sources and their lexical category alignment after using their compressed versions through PCA, and analyzes the results through histograms and normality tests such as Shapiro-Wilk and Anderson-Darling Tests. By focusing on ASCII codes, this approach simplifies text processing, although not replacing any syntactic tools but complementing them by offering it as a resource-efficient tool for assessing text balance.

We first focus on training long COT models from scratch, specifically starting from models initially lacking long COT capabilities. Using a curriculum training recipe consisting of two-stage SFT and semi-on-policy DPO, we train our model Light-R1-32B from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, resulting in superior math performance compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B. Despite being trained exclusively on math data, Light-R1-32B shows strong generalization across other domains. In the subsequent phase of this work, we highlight the significant benefit of the 3k dataset constructed for the second SFT stage on enhancing other models. By fine-tuning DeepSeek-R1-Distilled models using this dataset, we obtain new SOTA models in 7B and 14B, while the 32B model, Light-R1-32B-DS performed comparably to QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1.
Furthermore, we extend our work by applying reinforcement learning, specifically GRPO, on long-COT models to further improve reasoning performance. We successfully train our final Light-R1-14B-DS with RL, achieving SOTA performance among 14B parameter models in math. With AIME24 & 25 scores of 74.0 and 60.2 respectively, Light-R1-14B-DS surpasses even many 32B models and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B.

However, existing code benchmarks remain static, consisting of fixed datasets with predefined problems. This makes them vulnerable to memorization during training, where LLMs recall specific test cases instead of generalizing to new problems, leading to data contamination and unreliable evaluation results. To address these issues, we introduce DynaCode, a dynamic, complexity-aware benchmark that overcomes the limitations of static datasets. DynaCode evaluates LLMs systematically using a complexity-aware metric, incorporating both code complexity and call-graph structures. DynaCode achieves large-scale diversity, generating up to 189 million unique nested code problems across four distinct levels of code complexity, referred to as units, and 16 types of call graphs. Results on 12 latest LLMs show an average performance drop of 16.8% to 45.7% compared to MBPP+, a static code generation benchmark, with performance progressively decreasing as complexity increases. This demonstrates DynaCode's ability to effectively differentiate LLMs. Additionally, by leveraging call graphs, we gain insights into LLM behavior, particularly their preference for handling subfunction interactions within nested code.",13/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

This position paper argues that LRMs substantially transformed traditional neural MT as well as LLMs-based MT paradigms by reframing translation as a dynamic reasoning task that requires contextual, cultural, and linguistic understanding and reasoning. We identify three foundational shifts: 1) contextual coherence, where LRMs resolve ambiguities and preserve discourse structure through explicit reasoning over cross-sentence and complex context or even lack of context; 2) cultural intentionality, enabling models to adapt outputs by inferring speaker intent, audience expectations, and socio-linguistic norms; 3) self-reflection, LRMs can perform self-reflection during the inference time to correct the potential errors in translation especially extremely noisy cases, showing better robustness compared to simply mapping X->Y translation. We explore various scenarios in translation including stylized translation, document-level translation and multimodal translation by showcasing empirical examples that demonstrate the superiority of LRMs in translation. We also identify several interesting phenomenons for LRMs for MT including auto-pivot translation as well as the critical challenges such as over-localisation in translation and inference efficiency. In conclusion, we think that LRMs redefine translation systems not merely as text converters but as multilingual cognitive agents capable of reasoning about meaning beyond the text. This paradigm shift reminds us to think of problems in translation beyond traditional translation scenarios in a much broader context with LRMs - what we can achieve on top of it.",13/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

KV-Distill can be trained as a parameter-efficient adaptor for pretrained models, and enables the compression of arbitrary spans of a context while preserving pre-trained model capabilities. We treat a compressed-uncompressed cache as a student-teacher pairing and apply a KL-type divergence to match the generated outputs. KV-Distill outperforms other compression techniques in worst-case extractive tasks and approaches uncompressed performance in long context question answering and summarization, and it can be fine-tuned on domain-specific contexts to reduce lengths by up to 99% while preserving downstream performance.

Modern techniques typically rely on large models for representing general knowledge of one or several languages (Large Language Models, LLMs), or for representing speech and general audio characteristics. These models have been trained with large amounts of speech and language data, typically including web content. When humans interact with such technologies, the effectiveness of the interaction will be influenced by how far humans make use of the same type of language the models have been trained on or, in other words, if the models are able to generalize to the language used by humans when interacting with the technology. This may lead to some gradual forms of adaptation in human speech and language production, and users who do not adapt may be excluded from efficient use of such technologies. On top of this, as commercial model development follows market needs, under-represented languages and dialects/sociolects may decrease in terms of priorities. Furthermore, for many lesser spoken languages the necessary data is not available, which will worsen a digital divide in speech and language technology usage.

Automatic text summarization has emerged as a powerful tool to condense lengthy documents into concise and informative summaries. Depending on the approach used, text summarization can be categorized as either extractive or abstractive. While extractive methods are commonly used due to their simplicity, they often miss important information.

Existing methods primarily focus on aligning inputs and outputs across modalities while overlooking deeper semantic alignment within model representations. To address this limitation, we propose an Adaptive Inner Speech-Text Alignment (AI-STA) method to bridge the modality gap by explicitly aligning speech and text representations at selected layers within LLMs. To achieve this, we leverage the optimal transport (OT) theory to quantify fine-grained representation discrepancies between speech and text. Furthermore, we utilize the cross-modal retrieval technique to identify the layers that are best suited for alignment and perform joint training on these layers. Experimental results on speech translation (ST) tasks demonstrate that AI-STA significantly improves the translation performance of large speech-text models (LSMs), outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches.

At its core, PRISM adopts a 3D Point Cloud-Language Model (3D-PC-LLM) to mitigate occlusion and viewpoint biases, ensuring more stable and spatially consistent preference signals. Additionally, PRISM leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to incorporate long-horizon considerations, thereby preventing the short-sighted feedback often seen in static preference comparisons. In contrast to conventional PBRL techniques, this integration of 3D perception and future-oriented reasoning leads to significant gains in preference agreement rates, faster policy convergence, and robust generalization across unseen robotic environments. Our empirical results, spanning tasks such as robotic manipulation and autonomous navigation, highlight PRISM's potential for real-world applications where precise spatial understanding and reliable long-term decision-making are critical.

Ngai, Emad Barsoum","Speculative decoding (SPD) aims to accelerate the auto-regressive token generation process of a target Large Language Model (LLM). Some approaches employ a draft model with multiple heads to predict a sequence of future tokens, where each head handles a token in the sequence. The target LLM verifies the predicted sequence and accepts aligned tokens, enabling efficient multi-token generation. However, existing methods assume that all tokens within a sequence are equally important, employing identical head structures and relying on a single-generation paradigm, either serial or parallel. To this end, we theoretically demonstrate that initial tokens in the draft sequence are more important than later ones. Building on this insight, we propose Gumiho, a hybrid model combining serial and parallel heads. Specifically, given the critical importance of early tokens, we employ a sophisticated Transformer architecture for the early draft heads in a serial configuration to improve accuracy. For later tokens, we utilize multiple lightweight MLP heads operating in parallel to enhance efficiency. By allocating more advanced model structures and longer running times to the early heads, Gumiho achieves improved overall performance.

This study evaluates structured reasoning techniques-Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Self-Consistency (SC-CoT), and Tree-of-Thought (ToT)-to improve classification accuracy across multiple mental health datasets sourced from Reddit. We analyze reasoning-driven prompting strategies, including Zero-shot CoT and Few-shot CoT, using key performance metrics such as Balanced Accuracy, F1 score, and Sensitivity/Specificity. Our findings indicate that reasoning-enhanced techniques improve classification performance over direct prediction, particularly in complex cases. Compared to baselines such as Zero Shot non-CoT Prompting, and fine-tuned pre-trained transformers such as BERT and Mental-RoBerta, and fine-tuned Open Source LLMs such as Mental Alpaca and Mental-Flan-T5, reasoning-driven LLMs yield notable gains on datasets like Dreaddit (+0.52\% over M-LLM, +0.82\% over BERT) and SDCNL (+4.67\% over M-LLM, +2.17\% over BERT). However, performance declines in Depression Severity, and CSSRS predictions suggest dataset-specific limitations, likely due to our using a more extensive test set. Among prompting strategies, Few-shot CoT consistently outperforms others, reinforcing the effectiveness of reasoning-driven LLMs. Nonetheless, dataset variability highlights challenges in model reliability and interpretability.

This stability allows the transformation of the sampling process from the target policy into a re-ranking of preference data. Building on this hypothesis, We propose a new framework that leverages the model's intrinsic safety judgment capability to extract reward signals, which are then used to calculate label confidence for preferences reordering.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a practical solution, supported by several theoretical studies. However, current CoT-based methods (including ToT, GoT, etc.) generally adopt a ""one-prompt-fits-all"" strategy, using fixed templates (e.g., ""think step by step"") across diverse reasoning tasks. This method forces models to navigate an extremely complex prompt space to identify effective reasoning paths.

In this paper, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the complexity and interplay between two crucial spaces: the prompt space (the space of potential prompt structures) and the answer space (the space of reasoning solutions generated by LLMs) in CoT reasoning. We demonstrate how reliance on a single universal prompt (e.g. think step by step) can negatively impact the theoretical computability of LLMs, illustrating that prompt complexity directly influences the structure and effectiveness of the navigation in answer space.

Luoma, Hani J Marcus","Introduction: Timely care in a specialised neuro-intensive therapy unit (ITU) reduces mortality and hospital stays, with planned admissions being safer than unplanned ones. However, post-operative care decisions remain subjective. This study used artificial intelligence (AI), specifically natural language processing (NLP) to analyse electronic health records (EHRs) and predict ITU admissions for elective surgery patients. Methods: This study analysed the EHRs of elective neurosurgery patients from University College London Hospital (UCLH) using NLP. Patients were categorised into planned high dependency unit (HDU) or ITU admission; unplanned HDU or ITU admission; or ward / overnight recovery (ONR). The Medical Concept Annotation Tool (MedCAT) was used to identify SNOMED-CT concepts within the clinical notes. We then explored the utility of these identified concepts for a range of AI algorithms trained to predict ITU admission. Results: The CogStack-MedCAT NLP model, initially trained on hospital-wide EHRs, underwent two refinements: first with data from patients with Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) and then with data from Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) patients, achieving a concept detection F1-score of 0.93. This refined model was then used to extract concepts from EHR notes of 2,268 eligible neurosurgical patients. We integrated the extracted concepts into AI models, including a decision tree model and a neural time-series model. Using the simpler decision tree model, we achieved a recall of 0.87 (CI 0.82 - 0.91) for ITU admissions, reducing the proportion of unplanned ITU cases missed by human experts from 36% to 4%.

Mapping Scientific Research with Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models,"Abhipsha Das, Nicholas Lourie, Siavash Golkar, Mariel Pettee","The scientific literature's exponential growth makes it increasingly challenging to navigate and synthesize knowledge across disciplines. Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools for understanding scientific text, but they fail to capture detailed relationships across large bodies of work. Unstructured approaches, like retrieval augmented generation, can sift through such corpora to recall relevant facts; however, when millions of facts influence the answer, unstructured approaches become cost prohibitive. Structured representations offer a natural complement -- enabling systematic analysis across the whole corpus. Recent work enhances LLMs with unstructured or semistructured representations of scientific concepts; to complement this, we try extracting structured representations using LLMs. By combining LLMs' semantic understanding with a schema of scientific concepts, we prototype a system that answers precise questions about the literature as a whole. Our schema applies across scientific fields and we extract concepts from it using only 20 manually annotated abstracts. To demonstrate the system, we extract concepts from 30,000 papers on arXiv spanning astrophysics, fluid dynamics, and evolutionary biology.

To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Gromov-Wasserstein Scoring Model Merging (GW-SMM) method, which merges models based on feature distribution similarities measured via the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. Our approach begins by extracting features from student responses using individual models, capturing both item-specific context and unique learned representations. The Gromov-Wasserstein distance then quantifies the similarity between these feature distributions, identifying the most compatible models for merging. Models exhibiting the smallest pairwise distances, typically in pairs or trios, are merged by combining only the shared layers preceding the classification head. This strategy results in a unified feature extractor while preserving separate classification heads for item-specific scoring. We validated our approach against human expert knowledge and a GPT-o1-based merging method. GW-SMM consistently outperformed both, achieving a higher micro F1 score, macro F1 score, exact match accuracy, and per-label accuracy. The improvements in micro F1 and per-label accuracy were statistically significant compared to GPT-o1-based merging (p=0.04, p=0.01).

The growth of publicly available online restaurant reviews and advancements in large language models (LLMs) present potential opportunities to extend disease surveillance by identifying public reports of GI illness. In this study, we introduce a novel annotation schema, developed with experts in GI illness, applied to the Yelp Open Dataset of reviews.

Then, to explore how LMMs interpret multi-modal scientific content, we annotate another two versions, i.e., Vision-rich and -only, marking more question information from texts to diagrams. Comparing the results of different versions, SciVerse systematically examines the professional knowledge stock and visual perception skills of LMMs in scientific domains. In addition, to rigorously assess CoT reasoning, we propose a new scientific CoT evaluation strategy, conducting a step-wise assessment on knowledge and logical errors in model outputs. Our extensive evaluation of different LMMs on SciVerse reveals critical limitations in their scientific proficiency and provides new insights into future developments.

10.48550./arXiv.2503.10622,Transformers without Normalization,"Jiachen Zhu, Xinlei Chen, Kaiming He, Yann LeCun, Zhuang Liu","Normalization layers are ubiquitous in modern neural networks and have long been considered essential. This work demonstrates that Transformers without normalization can achieve the same or better performance using a remarkably simple technique. We introduce Dynamic Tanh (DyT), an element-wise operation $DyT($x$) = \tanh(\alpha $x$)$, as a drop-in replacement for normalization layers in Transformers. DyT is inspired by the observation that layer normalization in Transformers often produces tanh-like, $S$-shaped input-output mappings. By incorporating DyT, Transformers without normalization can match or exceed the performance of their normalized counterparts, mostly without hyperparameter tuning. We validate the effectiveness of Transformers with DyT across diverse settings, ranging from recognition to generation, supervised to self-supervised learning, and computer vision to language models. These findings challenge the conventional understanding that normalization layers are indispensable in modern neural networks, and offer new insights into their role in deep networks.",13/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje
10.48550./arXiv.2503.10619,Siege: Autonomous Multi-Turn Jailbreaking of Large Language Models with Tree Search,Andy Zhou,"We introduce Siege, a multi-turn adversarial framework that models the gradual erosion of Large Language Model (LLM) safety through a tree search perspective. Unlike single-turn jailbreaks that rely on one meticulously engineered prompt, Siege expands the conversation at each turn in a breadth-first fashion, branching out multiple adversarial prompts that exploit partial compliance from previous responses. By tracking these incremental policy leaks and re-injecting them into subsequent queries, Siege reveals how minor concessions can accumulate into fully disallowed outputs. Evaluations on the JailbreakBench dataset show that Siege achieves a 100% success rate on GPT-3.5-turbo and 97% on GPT-4 in a single multi-turn run, using fewer queries than baselines such as Crescendo or GOAT. This tree search methodology offers an in-depth view of how model safeguards degrade over successive dialogue turns, underscoring the urgency of robust multi-turn testing procedures for language models.",13/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje
10.48550./arXiv.2503.10602,TruthPrInt: Mitigating LVLM Object Hallucination Via Latent Truthful-Guided Pre-Intervention,"Jinhao Duan, Fei Kong, Hao Cheng, James Diffenderfer, Bhavya Kailkhura, Lichao Sun, Xiaofeng Zhu, Xiaoshuang Shi, Kaidi Xu","Object Hallucination (OH) has been acknowledged as one of the major trustworthy challenges in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) indicate that internal states, such as hidden states, encode the ""overall truthfulness"" of generated responses. However, it remains under-explored how internal states in LVLMs function and whether they could serve as ""per-token"" hallucination indicators, which is essential for mitigating OH. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth exploration of LVLM internal states in relation to OH issues and discover that (1) LVLM internal states are high-specificity per-token indicators of hallucination behaviors. Moreover, (2) different LVLMs encode universal patterns of hallucinations in common latent subspaces, indicating that there exist ""generic truthful directions"" shared by various LVLMs. Based on these discoveries, we propose Truthful-Guided Pre-Intervention (TruthPrInt) that first learns the truthful direction of LVLM decoding and then applies truthful-guided inference-time intervention during LVLM decoding. We further propose ComnHallu to enhance both cross-LVLM and cross-data hallucination detection transferability by constructing and aligning hallucination latent subspaces. We evaluate TruthPrInt in extensive experimental settings, including in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, over popular LVLMs and OH benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that TruthPrInt significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Codes will be available at this https URL.",13/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje
10.48550./arXiv.2503.10582,VisualWebInstruct: Scaling up Multimodal Instruction Data through Web Search,"Yiming Jia, Jiachen Li, Xiang Yue, Bo Li, Ping Nie, Kai Zou, Wenhu Chen","Vision-Language Models have made significant progress on many perception-focused tasks, however, their progress on reasoning-focused tasks seem to be limited due to the lack of high-quality and diverse training data. In this work, we aim to address the scarcity issue of reasoning-focused multimodal datasets. We propose VisualWebInstruct - a novel approach that leverages search engine to create a diverse, and high-quality dataset spanning multiple disciplines like math, physics, finance, chemistry, etc. Starting with meticulously selected 30,000 seed images, we employ Google Image search to identify websites containing similar images. We collect and process the HTMLs from over 700K unique URL sources. Through a pipeline of content extraction, filtering and synthesis, we build a dataset of approximately 900K question-answer pairs, with 40% being visual QA pairs and the rest as text QA pairs. Models fine-tuned on VisualWebInstruct demonstrate significant performance gains: (1) training from Llava-OV-mid shows 10-20% absolute point gains across benchmarks, (2) training from MAmmoTH-VL shows 5% absoluate gain. Our best model MAmmoTH-VL2 shows state-of-the-art performance within the 10B parameter class on MMMU-Pro-std (40.7%), MathVerse (42.6%), and DynaMath (55.7%). These remarkable results highlight the effectiveness of our dataset in enhancing VLMs' reasoning capabilities for complex multimodal tasks.",13/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje
10.48550./arXiv.2503.10542,"Language Models, Graph Searching, and Supervision Adulteration: When More Supervision is Less and How to Make More More",Arvid Frydenlund,"This work concerns the path-star task, a minimal example of searching over a graph. The graph, $G$, is star-shaped with $D$ arms radiating from a start node, $s$. A language model (LM) is given $G$, $s$, and a target node $t$, which ends one of the arms and is tasked with generating the arm containing $t$. The minimal nature of this task means only a single choice needs to be made: which of the $D$ arms contains $t$?
Decoder-only LMs fail to solve this elementary task above $1/D$ chance due to a learned shortcut that absorbs training supervision. We show how this pathology is caused by excess supervision and we present a series of solutions demonstrating that the task is solvable via decoder-only LMs. We find that the task's minimal nature causes its difficulty, as it prevents task decomposition. Our solutions provide insight into the pathology and its implications for LMs trained via next-token prediction.",13/03/2025,Computacion&Lenguaje

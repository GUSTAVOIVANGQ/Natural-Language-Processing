10.3390/jimaging10090208,Task-Adaptive Angle Selection for Computed Tomography-Based Defect Detection.,"Wang, Tianyuan,Florian, Virginia,Schielein, Richard,Kretzer, Christian,Kasperl, Stefan,Lucka, Felix,van Leeuwen, Tristan","Sparse-angle X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) plays a vital role in industrial quality control but leads to an inherent trade-off between scan time and reconstruction quality. Adaptive angle selection strategies try to improve upon this based on the idea that the geometry of the object under investigation leads to an uneven distribution of the information content over the projection angles. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as an effective approach for adaptive angle selection in X-ray CT. While previous studies focused on optimizing generic image quality measures using a fixed number of angles, our work extends them by considering a specific downstream task, namely image-based defect detection, and introducing flexibility in the number of angles used. By leveraging prior knowledge about typical defect characteristics, our task-adaptive angle selection method, adaptable in terms of angle count, enables easy detection of defects in the reconstructed images.",11/07/2024,Journal of imaging

10.3390/jimaging10080192,RailTrack-DaViT: A Vision Transformer-Based Approach for Automated Railway Track Defect Detection.,"Phaphuangwittayakul, Aniwat,Harnpornchai, Napat,Ying, Fangli,Zhang, Jinming","Railway track defects pose significant safety risks and can lead to accidents, economic losses, and loss of life. Traditional manual inspection methods are either time-consuming, costly, or prone to human error. This paper proposes RailTrack-DaViT, a novel vision transformer-based approach for railway track defect classification. By leveraging the Dual Attention Vision Transformer (DaViT) architecture, RailTrack-DaViT effectively captures both global and local information, enabling accurate defect detection. The model is trained and evaluated on multiple datasets including rail, fastener and fishplate, multi-faults, and ThaiRailTrack. A comprehensive analysis of the model's performance is provided including confusion matrices, training visualizations, and classification metrics. RailTrack-DaViT demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art CNN-based methods, achieving the highest accuracies: 96.9% on the rail dataset, 98.9% on the fastener and fishplate dataset, and 98.8% on the multi-faults dataset. Moreover, RailTrack-DaViT outperforms baselines on the ThaiRailTrack dataset with 99.2% accuracy, quickly adapts to unseen images, and shows better model stability during fine-tuning. This capability can significantly reduce time consumption when applying the model to novel datasets in practical applications.",22/06/2024,Journal of imaging
10.3390/jimaging10080197,A Multi-Scale Target Detection Method Using an Improved Faster Region Convolutional Neural Network Based on Enhanced Backbone and Optimized Mechanisms.,"Chen, Qianyong,Li, Mengshan,Lai, Zhenghui,Zhu, Jihong,Guan, Lixin","Currently, existing deep learning methods exhibit many limitations in multi-target detection, such as low accuracy and high rates of false detection and missed detections. This paper proposes an improved Faster R-CNN algorithm, aiming to enhance the algorithm's capability in detecting multi-scale targets. This algorithm has three improvements based on Faster R-CNN. Firstly, the new algorithm uses the ResNet101 network for feature extraction of the detection image, which achieves stronger feature extraction capabilities. Secondly, the new algorithm integrates Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM), Soft non-maximum suppression (Soft-NMS), and Distance Intersection Over Union (DIOU) modules, which improves the positive and negative sample imbalance and the problem of small targets being easily missed during model training. Finally, the Region Proposal Network (RPN) is simplified to achieve a faster detection speed and a lower miss rate. The multi-scale training (MST) strategy is also used to train the improved Faster R-CNN to achieve a balance between detection accuracy and efficiency. Compared to the other detection models, the improved Faster R-CNN demonstrates significant advantages in terms of mAP@0.5, F1-score, and Log average miss rate (LAMR). The model proposed in this paper provides valuable insights and inspiration for many fields, such as smart agriculture, medical diagnosis, and face recognition.",16/07/2024,Journal of imaging
10.3390/jimaging10090227,Leveraging Perspective Transformation for Enhanced Pothole Detection in Autonomous Vehicles.,"Abu-Raddaha, Abdalmalek,El-Shair, Zaid A,Rawashdeh, Samir","Road conditions, often degraded by insufficient maintenance or adverse weather, significantly contribute to accidents, exacerbated by the limited human reaction time to sudden hazards like potholes. Early detection of distant potholes is crucial for timely corrective actions, such as reducing speed or avoiding obstacles, to mitigate vehicle damage and accidents. This paper introduces a novel approach that utilizes perspective transformation to enhance pothole detection at different distances, focusing particularly on distant potholes. Perspective transformation improves the visibility and clarity of potholes by virtually bringing them closer and enlarging their features, which is particularly beneficial given the fixed-size input requirement of object detection networks, typically significantly smaller than the raw image resolutions captured by cameras. Our method automatically identifies the region of interest (ROI)-the road area-and calculates the corner points to generate a perspective transformation matrix. This matrix is applied to all images and corresponding bounding box labels, enhancing the representation of potholes in the dataset. This approach significantly boosts detection performance when used with YOLOv5-small, achieving a 43% improvement in the average precision (AP) metric at intersection-over-union thresholds of 0.5 to 0.95 for single class evaluation, and notable improvements of 34%, 63%, and 194% for near, medium, and far potholes, respectively, after categorizing them based on their distance. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to employ perspective transformation specifically for enhancing the detection of distant potholes.",06/08/2024,Journal of imaging
10.3390/jimaging10090215,"Concrete Crack Detection and Segregation: A Feature Fusion, Crack Isolation, and Explainable AI-Based Approach.","Swarna, Reshma Ahmed,Hossain, Muhammad Minoar,Khatun, Mst Rokeya,Rahman, Mohammad Motiur,Munir, Arslan","Scientific knowledge of image-based crack detection methods is limited in understanding their performance across diverse crack sizes, types, and environmental conditions. Builders and engineers often face difficulties with image resolution, detecting fine cracks, and differentiating between structural and non-structural issues. Enhanced algorithms and analysis techniques are needed for more accurate assessments. Hence, this research aims to generate an intelligent scheme that can recognize the presence of cracks and visualize the percentage of cracks from an image along with an explanation. The proposed method fuses features from concrete surface images through a ResNet-50 convolutional neural network (CNN) and curvelet transform handcrafted (HC) method, optimized by linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB) classifier then uses these features to recognize cracks. This study evaluates several CNN models, including VGG-16, VGG-19, Inception-V3, and ResNet-50, and various HC techniques, such as wavelet transform, counterlet transform, and curvelet transform for feature extraction. Principal component analysis (PCA) and LDA are assessed for feature optimization. For classification, XGB, random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and category boosting (CatBoost) are tested. To isolate and quantify the crack region, this research combines image thresholding, morphological operations, and contour detection with the convex hulls method and forms a novel algorithm. Two explainable AI (XAI) tools, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIMEs) and gradient-weighted class activation mapping++ (Grad-CAM++) are integrated with the proposed method to enhance result clarity. This research introduces a novel feature fusion approach that enhances crack detection accuracy and interpretability. The method demonstrates superior performance by achieving 99.93% and 99.69% accuracy on two existing datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the development of an algorithm for isolating and quantifying crack regions represents a significant advancement in image processing for structural analysis. The proposed approach provides a robust and reliable tool for real-time crack detection and assessment in concrete structures, facilitating timely maintenance and improving structural safety. By offering detailed explanations of the model's decisions, the research addresses the critical need for transparency in AI applications, thus increasing trust and adoption in engineering practice.",13/08/2024,Journal of imaging

Here, LAG3 was found to undergo robust non-K48-linked polyubiquitination upon ligand engagement, which promotes LAG3's inhibitory function instead of causing degradation. This ubiquitination could be triggered by the engagement of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) and membrane-bound (but not soluble) fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1). LAG3 ubiquitination, mediated redundantly by the E3 ligases c-Cbl and Cbl-b, disrupted the membrane binding of the juxtamembrane basic residue-rich sequence, thereby stabilizing the LAG3 cytoplasmic tail in a membrane-dissociated conformation enabling signaling. Furthermore, LAG3 ubiquitination is crucial for the LAG3-mediated suppression of antitumor immunity in vivo. Consistently, LAG3 therapeutic antibodies repress LAG3 ubiquitination, correlating with their checkpoint blockade effects. Moreover, patient cohort analyses suggest that LAG3/CBL coexpression could serve as a biomarker for response to LAG3 blockade. Collectively, our study reveals an immune-checkpoint-triggering mechanism with translational potential in cancer immunotherapy.",13/12/2023,Cell

The mechanisms underlying this effect remain elusive. Here, in vivo genome-wide CRISPR screening identifies SFRP2 as a potential stromal regulator of the abscopal effect. SFRP2 exhibits cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-specific expression and radioimmunotherapy-mediated upregulation in unirradiated tumors. Conditional Sfrp2 knockout in CAFs boosts the abscopal effect by rewiring the vascular-immune microenvironment to promote CD8(+) T cell recruitment to unirradiated tumors. In vivo lineage tracing reveals that elevated SFRP2 correlates with radioimmunotherapy-driven pericyte lineage commitment. Serum proteomics reveals that irradiated-tumor-secreted PAI-1 triggers distant tumor pericyte cell-fate transition into SFRP2(high) CAFs via the LRP1/p65 axis. Pharmacologically blocking SFRP2 or PAI-1 enhances the abscopal effect in humanized patient-derived xenograft models. Our findings collectively illustrate that PAI-1-induced SFRP2(high) CAFs serve as critical stromal regulator to hijack the abscopal effect, providing promising targets for enhancing radioimmunotherapy effectiveness.",21/06/2024,Cancer cell

However, the mechanisms regulating adipocyte functions remain unclear. Here, using multi-omics analyses, involving (phospho-)proteomics and lipidomics, we found that day-restricted feeding (DRF) regulates diurnal rhythms of the mitochondrial proteome, neutral lipidome, and nutrient-sensing pathways in mouse gonadal white adipose tissue (GWAT). Adipocyte-specific knockdown of Prkaa2 (the gene encoding AMPKα2) impairs physical endurance. This defect is associated with altered rhythmicity in acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) metabolism-related genes, a loss of rhythmicity in the GWAT lipidome, and circadian remodeling of serum metabolites-in particular, lactate and succinate. We also found that adipocyte Prkaa2 regulates muscle clock genes during DRF. Notably, oral administration of the AMPK activator C29 increases endurance and muscle functions in a time-of-day manner, which requires intact adipocyte AMPKα2 signaling. Collectively, our work defines adipocyte AMPKα2 signaling as a critical regulator of circadian metabolic coordination between fat and muscle, thereby enhancing exercise performance.",16/07/2024,Cell metabolism

This study aims to explore the association between the composite dietary antioxidant index (CDAI) and sarcopenia, offering new insights into nutritional strategies for sarcopenia-prone populations. METHODS: This cross-sectional study analysed secondary data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cycles spanning 2001-2006 and 2011-2018. Weighted multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analyses were employed to evaluate the non-linear association between CDAI and sarcopenia and to perform stratified analyses. RESULTS: In this study, encompassing 19 683 American adults, representative of the national population of 132 140 502 residents, 7.97% were diagnosed with sarcopenia. Across all adjusted models, a higher CDAI was inversely associated with the risk of sarcopenia (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.92, 0.96; P<0.0001). The highest quartile of CDAI scores to those in the lowest revealed significantly reduced odds of sarcopenia (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.38, 0.56; P<0.0001). RCS analysis demonstrated a non-linear relationship between CDAI and sarcopenia. Additionally, stratified analyses indicated that the inverse association between CDAI and sarcopenia was more pronounced among participants with higher educational levels and those diagnosed with tumours. CONCLUSIONS: There was a negative relationship between CDAI scores and the prevalence of sarcopenia, suggesting that higher CDAI scores may help in managing and preventing the occurrence of sarcopenia.",10/05/2024,BMJ public health

Traditional two-dimensional (2D) cultures fail to propagate a large subpopulation of murine primary tumors in vitro. However, three-dimensional (3D) air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures, which are employed to grow normal lung organoids, can be used to efficiently culture cancerous lung tumor cells. Here, we detail a procedure for cultivating genetically modified lung organoids in 3D-ALI cultures. This protocol contains two parts. The first part describes how to transduce lung epithelial cells, which are either freshly sorted from lungs or from actively growing murine organoids, with virus in order to modify gene expression. The target lung cells are incubated with virus for 1-2 h for transduction. Then, the transduced cells are thoroughly washed and mixed with stromal support cells and Matrigel and are loaded into transwell inserts for culture and validated for genetic modifications through downstream assays. The second part describes how to isolate tumor cells growing orthotopically in genetically engineered mouse models to produce organoid cell lines that can be used for ex vivo drug discovery assays. For this protocol, tumors are isolated from lungs of mice, finely chopped and washed. Then, tumor chunks are mixed with Matrigel for 3D-ALI culture. Finally, organoids budding from tumor chunks are trypsinized and passaged to establish an organoid line. Together these two protocols provide a promising platform to study the genesis, progression, and treatment of lung cancer.",15/07/2024,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)"

However, the molecular mechanisms behind primate skeletal muscle ageing remain largely unexplored. Here, we show that SIRT5 expression is reduced in aged primate skeletal muscles from both genders. SIRT5 deficiency in human myotubes hastens cellular senescence and intensifies inflammation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that TBK1 is a natural substrate for SIRT5. SIRT5 desuccinylates TBK1 at lysine 137, which leads to TBK1 dephosphorylation and the suppression of the downstream inflammatory pathway. Using SIRT5 lentiviral vectors for skeletal muscle gene therapy in male mice enhances physical performance and alleviates age-related muscle dysfunction. This study sheds light on the molecular underpinnings of skeletal muscle ageing and presents the SIRT5-TBK1 pathway as a promising target for combating age-related skeletal muscle degeneration.",23/06/2024,Nature metabolism

Rat AD models were established by an operation (OP) in which rats were treated with a one-time intra-cerebroventricuIar injection of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) and continuous gavage of aluminum chloride every day for 4 weeks. GRE was administered intra-gastrically to rats. After 35 days, learning and memory were assessed in all of the rats. Brain sections were processed for immunohistochemistry and Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) and Nissl staining. The latency to show significant memory deficits was shorter in the group that received OP with a high dose of GRE (HG)(OP+HG) than in the groups that received OP with a low or moderate dose of GRE (LG, MG)(OP+LG, OP+MG) (p<0.05). The expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the OP+MG and OP+LG groups was up-regulated compared to the OP+HG groups (p<0.05). The rats in the OP+HG groups had lower levels of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and malondialdehyde (MDA) expression than the rats in the OP+MG and OP+LG groups (p<0.05).

Here we show, using a specialized method to isolate EC and microglial nuclei from postmortem human cortex (92 donors, 50 male and 42 female, aged 20-98 years), that intranuclear cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes enables simultaneous profiling of nuclear proteins and RNA transcripts at a single-nucleus resolution. We identify a disease-associated subset of capillary ECs in Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal degeneration. These capillaries exhibit reduced nuclear β-catenin and β-catenin-downstream genes, along with elevated TNF/NF-κB markers. Notably, these transcriptional changes correlate with the loss of nuclear TDP-43, an RNA-binding protein also depleted in neuronal nuclei. TDP-43 disruption in human and mouse ECs replicates these alterations, suggesting that TDP-43 deficiency in ECs is an important factor contributing to blood-brain barrier breakdown in neurodegenerative diseases.",03/01/2024,Nature neuroscience

These metabolites act on intestinal mucosa to regulate the immune response and control lipid uptake, which protects against obesity. We further demonstrate that T cells and B cells are not vital for 4HPAA-mediated obesity prevention, and innate lymphoid cells have antagonistic roles.

10.1016/j.jbc.2025.108413,"The Structural Basis of Substrate Selectivity of the Acinetobactin Biosynthetic Adenylation Domain, BasE.","Ahmed, Syed Fardin,Gulick, Andrew M","Siderophores are small molecule natural products that are often produced by enzymes called non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) that many pathogenic bacteria produce to adapt to low iron conditions. NRPS bioengineering could lead to the production of siderophore analogs with the potential to interrupt this unique bacterial iron uptake system, endowing the molecules with antimicrobial properties. Acinetobacter baumannii produces the catecholate siderophore acinetobactin to scavenge iron, a nutrient essential for several metabolic processes. Previous studies have reported synthetic analogs of acinetobactin that disrupt iron acquisition by A. baumannii, resulting in inhibition of bacterial growth. To foster a long-term goal of using a chemoenzymatic approach to produce additional analogs, we have targeted the adenylation domain BasE for the incorporation of alternate substrates. Here we report a structure-guided approach to investigate the substrate selectivity of BasE for non-native aryl substrates. Using targeted mutagenesis in the active site of BasE, we generated mutants that catalyze the activation of alternate substrates with catalytic efficiencies comparable to the wildtype enzyme with its natural substrate 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB). We further solved structures of these mutants bound to the non-native substrates that illustrate an expanded binding pocket that support the improved promiscuity of BasE. Motivated to develop an approach to produce analogs of acinetobactin, including molecules that could block iron uptake or be readily conjugated to antibiotic cargo, our work aims to develop a structure-guided approach for using catecholate siderophore pathways to incorporate alternate substrates.",29/01/2025,The Journal of biological chemistry

OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of inhaled sevoflurane compared with intravenous propofol for sedation in patients with ARDS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Phase 3 randomized, open-label, assessor-blinded clinical trial conducted from May 2020 to October 2023 with 90-day follow-up. Adults with early moderate to severe ARDS (defined by a ratio of Pao2 to the fraction of inspired oxygen of <150 mm Hg with a positive end-expiratory pressure of ≥8 cm H2O) were enrolled in 37 French intensive care units. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to a strategy of inhaled sedation with sevoflurane (intervention group) or to a strategy of intravenous sedation with propofol (control group) for up to 7 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was the number of ventilator-free days at 28 days; the key secondary end point was 90-day survival. RESULTS: Of 687 patients enrolled (mean [SD] age, 65 [12] years; 30% female), 346 were randomized to sevoflurane and 341 to propofol. The median total duration of sedation was 7 days (IQR, 4 to 7) in both groups. The number of ventilator-free days through day 28 was 0.0 days (IQR, 0.0 to 11.9) in the sevoflurane group and 0.0 days (IQR, 0.0 to 18.7) in the propofol group (median difference, -2.1 [95% CI, -3.6 to -0.7]; standardized hazard ratio, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.50 to 0.97]). The 90-day survival rates were 47.1% and 55.7% in the sevoflurane and propofol groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.05 to 1.62]). Among 4 secondary outcomes, sevoflurane was associated with higher 7-day mortality (19.4% vs 13.5%, respectively; relative risk, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.02 to 2.03]) and fewer intensive care unit-free days through day 28 (median, 0.0 [IQR, 0.0 to 6.0] vs 0.0 [IQR, 0.0 to 15.0]; median difference, -2.5 [95% CI, -3.7 to -1.4]) compared with propofol.

However, patients inevitably develop acquired drug resistance, resulting in recurrence or metastasis. It is important to identify novel effective therapeutic targets to reverse acquired TKI resistance. RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis revealed that nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) was upregulated in EGFR-TKI resistant cells and tissues via EGR1-mediated transcriptional activation. High NNMT levels were correlated with poor prognosis in EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients, which could promote resistance to EGFR-TKIs in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, NNMT catalyzed the conversion of nicotinamide to 1-methyl nicotinamide by depleting S-adenosyl methionine (the methyl group donor), leading to a reduction in H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and subsequent epigenetic activation of EGR1 and ALDH3A1. In addition, ALDH3A1 activation increased lactic acid levels, which further promoted NNMT expression via p300-mediated histone H3K18 lactylation on its promoter. Thus, NNMT mediates the formation of a double positive feedback loop via EGR1 and lactate, EGR1/NNMT/EGR1 and NNMT/ALDH3A1/lactate/NNMT. Moreover, the combination of a small-molecule inhibitor for NNMT (NNMTi) and osimertinib exhibited promising potential for the treatment of TKI resistance in an NSCLC osimertinib-resistant xenograft model. CONCLUSIONS: The combined contribution of these two positive feedback loops promotes EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC. Our findings provide new insight into the role of histone methylation and histone lactylation in TKI resistance. The pivotal NNMT-mediated positive feedback loop may serve as a powerful therapeutic target for overcoming EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC.",09/10/2024,Molecular cancer

By contrast with hospital-acquired MRSA, community-acquired MRSA is more susceptible to non b-lactam antibiotics. We investigated the high virulence potential of certain strains of this bacterium. METHODS: We ascertained the whole genome sequence of MW2, a strain of community-acquired MRSA, by shotgun cloning and sequencing. MW2 caused fatal septicaemia and septic arthritis in a 16-month-old girl in North Dakota, USA, in 1998. The genome of this strain was compared with those of hospital-acquired MRSA strains, including N315 and Mu50. FINDINGS: Meticillin resistance gene (mecA) in MW2 was carried by a novel allelic form (type IVa) of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), by contrast with type II in N315 and Mu50. Type IVa SCCmec did not carry any of the multiple antibiotic resistance genes reported in type II SCCmec. By contrast, 19 additional virulence genes were recorded in the MW2 genome. All but two of these virulence genes were noted in four of the seven genomic islands of MW2. INTERPRETATION: MW2 carried a range of virulence and resistance genes that was distinct from those displayed on the chromosomes of extant S aureus strains. Most genes were carried by specific allelic forms of genomic islands in the MW2 chromosome. The combination of allelic forms of genomic islands is the genetic basis that determines the pathogenicity of medically important phenotypes of S aureus, including those of community-acquired MRSA strains.",05/06/2002,"Lancet (London, England)"

We defined a nutrient signaling mechanism involving fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5) and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) that is activated by the essential polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ω-6 linoleic acid (LA). FABP5 directly bound to the regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) to enhance formation of functional mTORC1 and substrate binding, ultimately converging on increased mTOR signaling and proliferation. The amounts of FABP5 protein were increased in tumors and serum from triple-negative compared with those from receptor-positive breast cancer patients, which highlights its potential role as a biomarker that mediates cellular responses to ω-6 LA intake in this disease subtype.",14/03/2025,"Science (New York, N.Y.)"

Nrf3 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 3) has an established role in regulating redox signaling and tissue homeostasis. Here, we aimed to evaluate the role and mechanism of Nrf3 in injury-induced pathological cardiac remodeling. METHODS: Global (Nrf3-KO) and CM-specific (Nrf3(△CM)) Nrf3 knockout mice were subjected to MI or ischemia/reperfusion injury, followed by functional and histopathological analysis. Primary neonatal mouse and rat ventricular myocytes and CMs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells were used to evaluate the impact of Nrf3 on CM apoptosis and mitochondrial ROS production. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry analysis were used to uncover potential targets of Nrf3. MitoParaquat administration and CM-specific adeno-associated virus vectors were used to further confirm the in vivo relevance of the identified signal pathways. RESULTS: Nrf3 was expressed mainly in CMs in healthy human hearts, and an increased level of Nrf3 was observed in CMs within the border zone of infarcted human hearts and murine cardiac tissues after MI. Both global and CM-specific Nrf3 knockout significantly decreased injury-induced mitochondrial ROS production, CM apoptosis, and pathological cardiac remodeling, consequently improving cardiac functions. In addition, cardiac-specific Nrf3 overexpression reversed the ameliorative cardiac phenotypes observed in Nrf3-KO mice. Functional studies showed that Nrf3 promoted neonatal mouse ventricular myocyte, neonatal rat ventricular myocyte, and CMs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cell apoptosis by increasing mitochondrial ROS production. Critically, augmenting mitochondrial ROS with MitoParaquat blunted the beneficial effects of Nrf3 deletion on cardiac function and remodeling. Mechanistically, a redox regulator Pitx2 (paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2) was identified as one of the main target genes of Nrf3. Specifically, Nrf3 binds to Pitx2 promoter, where it increases DNA methylation through recruiting heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K and DNA-methyltransferase 1 complex, thereby inhibiting Pitx2 expression. CM-specific knockdown of Pitx2 blunted the beneficial effects of Nrf3 deletion on cardiac function and remodeling, and cardiac-specific Pitx2 overexpression attenuated MI-induced mitochondrial ROS production and CM apoptosis, as well as preserved cardiac functions after MI. CONCLUSIONS: Nrf3 promotes injury-induced CM apoptosis and deteriorates cardiac functions by increasing mitochondrial ROS production through suppressing Pitx2 expression. Targeting the Nrf3-Pitx2-mitochondrial ROS signal axis may therefore represent a novel therapeutic approach for MI treatment.",18/03/2025,Circulation

However, the underlying mechanism by which astrocytes within PFC contribute to MDD remains unclear. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing analyses, we show a significant reduction in astrocytes and attenuated pleiotrophin-protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z1 (PTN-PTPRZ1) signaling in astrocyte-to-excitatory neuron communication in the PFC of male MDD patients. We find reduced astrocytes and PTN in the dorsomedial PFC of male mice with depression induced by chronic restraint and social defeat stress. Knockdown of astrocytic PTN induces depression-related responses, which is reversed by exogenous PTN supplementation or overexpression of astrocytic PTN. The antidepressant effects exerted by astrocytic PTN require interaction with PTPRZ1 in excitatory neurons, and PTN-PTPRZ1 activates the AKT signaling pathway to regulate depression-related responses. Our findings indicate the PTN-PTPRZ1-AKT pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for MDD.",01/11/2024,Nature communications

Radiation injury depletes proliferative intestinal stem cells (ISCs); in response to this, the epithelium activates a regenerative program that facilitates the healing of the intestine. However, the mechanisms that induce the activation of the intestinal regenerative program are poorly characterized. METHODS: In this study, we induced radiation-induced enteritis in mice through abdominal irradiation, mimicking clinical scenarios. Through imaging and flow cytometric analysis, we investigated the recruitment of macrophages to the small intestine during injury and healing. Additionally, we developed a co-culture system for mouse and human intestinal organoids and macrophages to explore the crosstalk between these cells. Then combining in vivo ablation of macrophages, fluorescent lineage tracing, imaging, bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), human intestinal organoids and cell trajectory analysis, we study at cellular and molecular level the macrophage induction of intestinal regeneration. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that macrophages are recruited around the intestinal stem cell compartment upon radiation injury, promoting a fetal-like reprogramming and proliferation of epithelial cells that drives the regeneration process. In contrast macrophage ablation led to compromised regeneration. Moreover, our scRNA-seq analysis identified key secreted molecules, nrg1 and spp1, as pivotal players in regulating this process. Additionally, characterization of human macrophage/organoid co-cultures and cell trajectory inference confirmed the conservation of macrophages' role in triggering the regenerative program in primary human cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies macrophages as essential contributors to intestinal regeneration beyond their innate immune response. Targeting macrophages therapeutically may hold promise in enhancing regeneration and improving the quality of life for cancer survivors.",14/05/2024,Gastroenterology

The enduring consequences of these earthquakes on daily life triggered widespread fears and anxieties in society, leading to scholarly investigations in this field. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to create and evaluate the psychometric properties of the Fear of Earthquake Scale (FES), a modified adaptation of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19 S), tailored to measure earthquake-related experiences in Türkiye. METHODS: A total of 315 Turkish adult participants (106 men, 209 women), with a mean age of 37.71 years, completed the FES, along with the Brief Psychological Resilience Scale (BPRS). Psychometric analyses included confirmatory factor analysis as well as the evaluation of alternative factor structures, internal consistency, convergent validity, and criterion validity with respect to resilience. RESULTS: The findings indicate that the Turkish version of the Fear of Earthquake Scale has strong psychometric properties in terms of validity and reliability. After assessing various factor structures, it was observed that the two-factor model which represents the emotional and somatic response to fear, exhibited the best-fit values The Cronbach's alpha coefficients were calculated as 0.89 for the overall FES, 0.84 for the emotional subscale and 0.86 for the somatic subscale, indicating high internal consistency. Additionally, the negative correlation between resilience and the FES supports the criterion validity of the scale, and multi-group confirmatory factor analyses proved that measurement invariance held across genders and whether they experienced an earthquake or not for all groups. Furthermore, the results of the study revealed that women and individuals with prior earthquake experience reported higher levels of fear of earthquakes. CONCLUSIONS: The FES emerged as a reliable and valid tool for assessing earthquake-related fears among the Turkish population.",06/09/2023,BMC psychology

In this work, we identify FPR2 as a membrane receptor that specifically binds long-chain ceramides (C14-C20). In brown and beige adipocytes, C16:0 ceramide binding to FPR2 inhibits thermogenesis via G(i)-cyclic AMP signaling pathways, an effect that is reversed in the absence of FPR2. We present three cryo-electron microscopy structures of FPR2 in complex with G(i) trimers bound to C16:0, C18:0 and C20:0 ceramides. The hydrophobic tails are deeply embedded in the orthosteric ligand pocket, which has a limited amount of plasticity. Modification of the ceramide binding motif in closely related receptors, such as FPR1 or FPR3, converts them from inactive to active ceramide receptors.

This study uncovers LDHB's role in countering mitochondria-associated ferroptosis independently of lactate's function as a carbon source. LDHB silencing alters mitochondrial morphology, causes lipid peroxidation, and reduces cancer cell viability, which is potentiated by the ferroptosis inducer RSL3. Unlike LDHA, LDHB acts in parallel with glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) to suppress mitochondria-associated ferroptosis by decreasing the ubiquinone (coenzyme Q, CoQ) to ubiquinol (CoQH2) ratio. Indeed, supplementation with mitoCoQH2 (mitochondria-targeted analogue of CoQH2) suppresses mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and cell death after combined LDHB silencing and RSL3 treatment, consistent with the presence of LDHB in the cell fraction containing the mitochondrial inner membrane. Addressing the underlying molecular mechanism, an in vitro NADH consumption assay with purified human LDHB reveals that LDHB catalyzes the transfer of reducing equivalents from NADH to CoQ and that the efficiency of this reaction increases by the addition of lactate. Finally, radiation therapy induces mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and reduces tumor growth, which is further enhanced when combined with LDHB silencing. Thus, LDHB-mediated lactate oxidation drives the CoQ-dependent suppression of mitochondria-associated ferroptosis, a promising target for combination therapies.",31/07/2024,Nature communications

However, disease relapse is still common, and the mechanism of resistance remains poorly understood. In this study, we conducted whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) on MM samples from 10 patients who relapsed after GPRC5D CAR T-cell therapy. Among these patients, 8 had GPRC5D loss, while 2 presented mixed expression (GPRC5D+/-). Genetic alterations were identified in three cases: one had a homozygous deletion in the GPRC5D gene, another had a biallelic loss in the regulatory regions of GPRC5D, and the third had homozygous deletions in both TNFRSF17 and GPRC5D after sequential anti-BCMA and anti-GPRC5D CAR T-cell therapies. No genetic changes were detected at GPRC5D locus in the remaining 7 cases. However, multiple hypermethylation sites were present in the transcriptional regulatory elements of the GPRC5D gene in 5 post-treatment MM samples. In MM cell lines, GPRC5D expression was inversely correlated with methylation levels in its regulatory regions. Furthermore, azacitidine treatment induced GPRC5D mRNA and protein expression in hypermethylated MM cell lines. Our findings highlight that biallelic genetic inactivation and hypermethylation-driven epigenetic silencing are key mechanisms contributing to GPRC5D loss and treatment resistance.",14/02/2025,Blood

When and whether a second agent, such as vasopressin, should be added is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To derive and validate a reinforcement learning model to determine the optimal initiation rule for vasopressin in adult, critically ill patients receiving norepinephrine for septic shock. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Reinforcement learning was used to generate the optimal rule for vasopressin initiation to improve short-term and hospital outcomes, using electronic health record data from 3608 patients who met the Sepsis-3 shock criteria at 5 California hospitals from 2012 to 2023. The rule was evaluated in 628 patients from the California dataset and 3 external datasets comprising 10 217 patients from 227 US hospitals, using weighted importance sampling and pooled logistic regression with inverse probability weighting. EXPOSURES: Clinical, laboratory, and treatment variables grouped hourly for 120 hours in the electronic health record. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: The derivation cohort (n = 3608) included 2075 men (57%) and had a median (IQR) age of 63 (56-70) years and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at shock onset of 5 (3-7 [range, 0-24, with higher scores associated with greater mortality]). The validation cohorts (n = 10 217) were 56% male (n = 5743) with a median (IQR) age of 67 (57-75) years and a SOFA score of 6 (4-9). In validation data, the model suggested vasopressin initiation in more patients (87% vs 31%), earlier relative to shock onset (median [IQR], 4 [1-8] vs 5 [1-14] hours), and at lower norepinephrine doses (median [IQR], 0.20 [0.08-0.45] vs 0.37 [0.17-0.69] µg/kg/min) compared with clinicians' actions. The rule was associated with a larger expected reward in validation data compared with clinician actions (weighted importance sampling difference, 31 [95% CI, 15-52]). The adjusted odds of hospital mortality were lower if vasopressin initiation was similar to the rule compared with different (odds ratio, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.73-0.91]), a finding consistent across external validation sets. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In adult patients with septic shock receiving norepinephrine, the use of vasopressin was variable. A reinforcement learning model developed and validated in several observational datasets recommended more frequent and earlier use of vasopressin than average care patterns and was associated with reduced mortality.",18/03/2025,JAMA

This study aimed to evaluate the cognitive profile, mental health, and quality of life in patients with chronic and episodic migraine during the interictal period, and to explore their relationship with sociodemographic and clinical variables. METHOD: This observational, descriptive, cross-sectional analytical study included 60 patients diagnosed with chronic or episodic migraine, who were enrolled in a health program for headache patients between 2010 and 2016. Cognitive function, anxiety and/or depression symptoms, and quality of life during the interictal period were assessed. Descriptive analyses were conducted, and associations were evaluated by configuring primary (type of migraine) and alternative events (cognitive impairment, depression and/or anxiety, and poor quality of life). RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 45 years (SD ± 8), with 83.3% being women and 93.3% belonging to middle and low socioeconomic strata. Of the 60 patients, 83.3% (50) were diagnosed with chronic migraine, while the remaining had episodic migraine. The use of one or more cognition-altering medications was observed in 90% of patients with chronic migraine and 60% of those with episodic migraine (p = 0.02). Anxiety was more prevalent in patients with episodic migraine, whereas depression was more common among those with chronic migraine. Female gender, middle socioeconomic status, and longer disease duration were significantly associated with chronic migraine. Among the 57 patients who completed the Mini-Mental State Examination, 38.6% had cognitive impairment, which decreased with longer migraine duration and better social interaction. Memory and selective attention were the most affected cognitive domains in both groups. No significant associations were found for the other variables after adjusting for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic migraine significantly impacts mental health, cognition, and quality of life, with depression and cognitive impairments being prevalent. Social interaction and longer disease duration may protect against cognitive decline, highlighting the need for multidisciplinary, personalized interventions addressing neurological and psychosocial challenges.",21/10/2024,BMC neurology

Despite the revolutionary impact of CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR19)-T cell therapy, >50% of patients relapse within a year. Both leukemia cell-intrinsic factors favoring immune escape and poor CAR-T cell persistence contribute significantly to clinical failure. Moreover, the expression of immune checkpoint receptors (ICRs) and their ligands within the complex bone marrow (BM) microenvironment may contribute to leukemia progression and therapy resistance. Here, we comprehensively characterized the expression of ICRs and their ligands in leukemic blasts, T cells, and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from B-ALL BM samples at diagnosis (n=47) and relapse (n=38), comparing them with age-matched healthy BM controls. Our findings reveal a significant upregulated expression of TIM-3 in T cells, and its ligand galectin-9 in both blasts and MSCs throughout disease progression. The expression levels of galectin-9 in B-ALL blasts and TIM-3 in CAR19-T cells negatively correlate with clinical outcome. Furthermore, we demonstrate that galectin-9 impairs CAR19-T cell homeostasis and cytotoxicity. Notably, an engineered TIM-3-Fc decoy receptor, delivered either by primary T cells co-administered with CAR19-T cells or via a bicistronic all-in-one CAR19-TIM-3-Fc construct, improved the anti-leukemia efficacy and persistence of CAR19-T cells in B-ALL patient-derived xenograft models.

Mechanistically, LTFe promotes the transcription of its target gene, lactotransferrin (LTF), by interacting with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F (HNRNPF) and facilitating enhancer-promoter chromatin interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LTFe-LTF axis facilitates ferroptosis by modulating iron transport. Notably, androgen receptor (AR) signaling disrupts LTFe-associated chromatin looping, leading to ferroptosis resistance. Therapeutically, co- administration of the AR inhibitor enzalutamide and the ferroptosis inducer RSL3 significantly suppressed tumor growth, offering a promising strategy for castration-resistant prostate cancer. Collectively, this study provides novel insights into the mechanistic role of eRNAs in prostate cancer, highlighting the LTFe-LTF axis as a critical epigenetic regulator and potential therapeutic target for improved treatment outcomes.",24/10/2024,Signal transduction and targeted therapy

We aimed to improve the diagnosis and early management of patients admitted to hospital (adults aged 16 years and older and children aged >28 days) with suspected acute brain infections at 13 hospitals in Brazil, India, and Malawi. METHODS: With hospital stakeholders, policy makers, and patient and public representatives, we co-designed a multifaceted clinical and laboratory intervention, informed by an evaluation of routine practice. The intervention, tailored for each setting, included a diagnostic and management algorithm, a lumbar puncture pack, a testing panel, and staff training. We used multivariable logistic regression and interrupted time series analysis to compare the coprimary outcomes-the percentage of patients achieving a syndromic diagnosis and the percentage achieving a microbiological diagnosis before and after the intervention. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04190303) and is complete. FINDINGS: Between Jan 5, 2021, and Nov 30, 2022, we screened 10 462 patients and enrolled a total of 2233 patients at 13 hospital sites connected to the four study centres in Brazil, India, and Malawi. 1376 (62%) were recruited before the intervention and 857 (38%) were recruited after the intervention. 2154 patients (96%) had assessment of the primary outcome (1330 [62%] patients recruited pre-intervention and 824 [38%] recruited post-intervention). The median age across centres was 23 years (IQR 6-44), with 1276 (59%) being adults aged 16 years or older and 888 (41%) children aged between 29 days and 15 years; 1264 (59%) patients were male and 890 (41%) were female. Data on race and ethnicity were not recorded. 1020 (77%) of 1320 patients received a syndromic diagnosis before the intervention, rising to 701 (86%) of 813 after the intervention (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1·81 [95% CI 1·40-2·34]; p<0·0001). A microbiological diagnosis was made in 294 (22%) of 1330 patients pre-intervention, increasing to 250 (30%) of 824 patients post-intervention (aOR 1·46 [95% CI 1·18-1·79]; p=0·00040). Interrupted time series analysis confirmed that these increases exceeded a modest underlying trend of improvement over time. The percentage receiving a lumbar puncture, time to appropriate therapy, and functional outcome also improved. INTERPRETATION: Diagnosis and management of patients with suspected acute brain infections improved following introduction of a simple intervention package across a diverse range of hospitals on three continents.

,"STUDIES ON PSEUDORABIES (INFECTIOUS BULBAR PARALYSIS, MAD ITCH) : I. HISTOLOGY OF THE DISEASE, WITH A NOTE ON THE SYMPTOMATOLOGY.","Hurst, E W","The histology of pseudorabies differs materially in various animal species. In the rabbit, subcutaneous, intradermal or intramuscular inoculation leads to local inflammation and necrosis. The infection ascends the peripheral nerve (possibly both interstitially and by the axis-cylinders) to the corresponding spinal ganglia and segments of the spinal cord, where primary degeneration of nerve and glial cells takes place. The nerve cell changes are probably responsible for the cardinal symptom of the disease, itching. Death ensues soon after virus reaches the medulla, before visible changes have been produced here. Intracerebral inoculation is followed by characteristic lesions in the meninges, in subpial glial cells and in superficially placed nerve cells. Morbid changes in the lungs are not necessarily related to the presence of virus, but specific lesions may be present. Intranuclear inclusions bearing some resemblance to those in herpetic encephalitis, yellow fever, etc., occur in cells derived from all embryonic layers. The disease in the guinea pig resembles closely that in the rabbit and is modified only by the slightly greater resistance of the animal. In the monkey after intracerebral inoculation, widespread degeneration and necrosis of cortical nerve cells are accompanied by the appearance of specific nuclear alterations in nerve and glial cells, but not in cells of mesodermal origin. No lesions are found in other viscera. In the spontaneous disease in the cow lesions approximate more closely to those in the monkey than to those in the rabbit. In the pig vascular and interstitial lesions predominate, nerve cell degeneration is relatively slight and typical inclusions are not observed. These differences probably explain the benign course of the malady following subcutaneous inoculation in this animal. The lymphatic system, too, participates in the reaction to the virus.",30/10/2009,The Journal of experimental medicine

Here, we report six cryo-EM structures of human MPC in three different states: three structures obtained at different conditions in intermembrane space (IMS)-open state with highest resolution of 3.2 Å, a structure of pyruvate-treated MPC in occluded state at 3.7 Å, and two structures in matrix-facing state bound with the inhibitor UK5099 or an inhibitory nanobody on the matrix side at 3.2 Å and 3.0 Å, respectively. MPC is assigned into a heterodimer consisting of MPC1 and MPC2, with the transmembrane domain adopting pseudo-C2-symmetry. Approximate rigid body movements occur between the IMS-open state and the occluded state, while structural changes primarily on the matrix side facilitate the transition between the occluded state and the matrix-facing state, revealing the alternating access mechanism during pyruvate transport. In the UK5099-bound structure, the inhibitor fits well and interacts extensively with a pocket that opens to the matrix side. Our findings provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying MPC-mediated substrate transport, and the recognition and inhibition by UK5099, which will facilitate future drug development targeting MPC.",10/04/2024,Nature

Novel hidden proteins encoded by circular RNAs play crucial roles in disease progression, yet their involvement in vascular remodeling diseases has not been comprehensively studied. This study identifies a novel protein derived from a circular RNA in VSMCs and demonstrates its potential role in regulating vascular remodeling. METHODS: Cell proliferation assays were performed to investigate the effects of circSETD2(14,15) on VSMC proliferation. Techniques such as vector construction, immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, and dual-luciferase reporter gene were used to confirm that circSETD2(14,15) encoded a novel protein, p-414aa. The interaction between p-414aa and HuR (human antigen R) was validated with techniques such as coimmunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and proximity ligation assay. Through experiments including RNA sequencing and RNA immunoprecipitation, the interaction between HuR and C-FOS (C-Fos proto-oncogene) mRNA was revealed. The role of p-414aa in neointimal hyperplasia was assessed with a carotid artery ligation model in male mice. RESULTS: Overexpression of circSETD2(14,15) inhibits VSMC phenotypic switching. The novel protein p-414aa, encoded by circSETD2(14,15), interacts with HuR to reduce C-FOS mRNA stability, thereby suppressing VSMC proliferation and ultimately inhibiting neointimal hyperplasia in male mice. CONCLUSIONS: We uncover a novel hidden protein derived from circSETD2(14,15), called p-414aa, that inhibits vascular remodeling. CircSETD2(14,15) and p-414aa may serve as potential therapeutic targets for vascular remodeling diseases.",18/03/2025,Circulation

However, the persistence of cancer cells with low levels or complete absence of the target antigen, thereby evading detection by CAR T cells, leads to relapse. These evasion mechanisms highlight the need for receptors with enhanced sensitivity and multispecificity. We introduce a synthetic chimeric T cell receptor (ChTCR) that confers superior antigen sensitivity compared with CARS and previous hybrid TCR designs and is readily adapted for bispecific targeting. ChTCRs replicate the structure of natural TCRs, form classical immune synapses and demonstrate TCR-like signaling. T cells expressing bispecific ChTCRs (Bi-ChTCRs) are more effective than bispecific CAR T cells in eradicating tumors with heterogeneous antigen expression in vivo in female mice. The Bi-ChTCR architecture is resilient and can be designed to target pairs of B cell and multiple myeloma antigens.

We show that VEGF blockade in combination with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA4) + anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) potentiated a multimodal mechanism dependent on B cell activating factor (BAFF), leading to a proinflammatory B cell response. It led to a BAFF- and interleukin (IL)-12-dependent expansion and rewiring of T regulatory cells (Tregs) toward an anti-tumor T helper-1 (Th-1)-like fragile state. We translated this approach to the clinic and observed immunological changes characterized by Treg cell expansion and rewiring toward fragile and unstable states. We explored the effect of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling on Treg cell transcriptional programming and established a mouse model ablating VEGFR2 expression on Treg cells.

Preclinical studies suggest that αSyn can exacerbate tau aggregation, implying that αSyn co-pathology may specifically contribute to the Aβ-induced aggregation of tau that drives neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD. To investigate this, we combined a novel CSF-based seed-amplification assay (SAA) to determine αSyn positivity with amyloid- and tau-PET neuroimaging in a large cohort ranging from cognitively normal individuals to those with dementia, examining whether αSyn co-pathology accelerates Aβ-driven tau accumulation and cognitive decline. METHODS: In 284 Aβ-positive and 308 Aβ-negative subjects, we employed amyloid-PET, Flortaucipir tau-PET, and a CSF-based αSyn seed-amplification assay (SAA) to detect in vivo αSyn aggregation. CSF p-tau(181) measures were available for 384 subjects to assess earliest tau abnormalities. A subset of 155 Aβ-positive and 135 Aβ-negative subjects underwent longitudinal tau-PET over approximately 2.5 years. Using linear regression models, we analyzed whether αSyn SAA positivity was linked to stronger Aβ-related increases in baseline fluid and PET tau biomarkers, faster Aβ-driven tau-PET increase, and more rapid cognitive decline. RESULTS: αSyn SAA positivity was more common in Aβ + vs. Aβ- subjects and increased with clinical severity (p < 0.001). Most importantly, αSyn positivity was also associated with greater amyloid-associated CSF p-tau(181) increases (p = 0.005) and higher tau-PET levels in AD-typical brain regions (p = 0.006). Longitudinal analyses confirmed further that αSyn positivity was associated with faster amyloid-related tau accumulation (p = 0.029) and accelerated amyloid-related cognitive decline, potentially driven driven by stronger tau pathology. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that αSyn co-pathology, detectable via CSF-based SAAs, is more prevalent in advanced AD and contributes to the development of aggregated tau pathology thereby driving faster cognitive decline. This highlights that a-Syn co-pathology may specifically accelerate amyloid-driven tau pathophysiology in AD, underscoring the need to consider αSyn in AD research and treatment strategies.",11/10/2024,Molecular neurodegeneration

Perturb-FISH recovers intracellular effects that are consistent with single-cell RNA-sequencing-based readouts of perturbation effects (Perturb-seq) in a screen of lipopolysaccharide response in cultured monocytes, and it uncovers intercellular and density-dependent regulation of the innate immune response. Similarly, in three-dimensional xenograft models, Perturb-FISH identifies tumor-immune interactions altered by genetic knockout. When paired with a functional readout in a separate screen of autism spectrum disorder risk genes in human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hIPSC) astrocytes, Perturb-FISH shows common calcium activity phenotypes and their associated genetic interactions and dysregulated molecular pathways.

METHODS: This open-label, multicentre, phase 1/2 study was done at six tertiary cancer centres in India. Phase 1 was a single-centre study done in Tata Memorial Hospital, India, in patients aged 18 years or older with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphomas. Phase 2 was a single-arm, multicentre, basket trial done in five tertiary cancer centres in patients aged 15 years and older with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or B-cell lymphoma. Eligible patients had a life expectancy of 12 weeks or more, an ECOG performance status of 0-1 (phase 1) or 0-2 (phase 2), and an adequate organ function. Patients underwent apheresis to obtain at least 1 × 10(9) lymphocytes to manufacture CAR T cells. Lymphodepletion therapy was done with cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) and fludarabine 30 mg/m(2) for 3 days or bendamustine 90 mg/m(2) for 2 days. Patients were then infused intravenously with talicabtagene autoleucel 1 × 10(7)-5 × 10(9) CAR T cells in a fractionated schedule (10%, 30%, and 60%, on days 0, 1, and 2, respectively) during phase 1 or at least 5 × 10(6) CAR T cells per kg (up to 2 × 10(9) CAR T cells) on day 0 during phase 2. The primary endpoints were safety (phase 1) and overall response rate (phase 2). The efficacy analysis was done in the efficacy evaluable cohort (all patients who received the target dose and 3 days of lymphodepletion therapy). The safety analysis was done in the safety population (all patients who received talicabtagene autoleucel). The trials are registered with Clinical Trial Registry-India (CTRI/2021/04/032727 and CTRI/2022/12/048211), and enrolment is closed. FINDINGS: Of 64 patients, 14 were enrolled in phase 1 (from May 11, 2021, to May 13, 2022) and 50 were enrolled in phase 2 (Dec 27, 2022, to Aug 31, 2023). The median age of the overall cohort was 44 years (IQR 27-57), and 49 (77%) of 64 patients were male and 15 (23%) were female. In phase 1, no dose-limiting toxicities occurred at doses of 2 × 10(6)-17 × 10(6) CAR T cells per kg. A dose of at least 5 × 10(6) CAR T cells per kg was chosen for phase 2 based on a complete response in three of seven patients at this dose. The most common grade 3 or worse toxicities were haematological events: anaemia (35 [61%] of 57 patients), thrombocytopenia (37 [65%] patients), neutropenia (55 [96%] patients, and febrile neutropenia (27 [47%]) patients). There were two treatment-related deaths, one due to febrile neutropenia, immune-effector cell associated haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and septic shock, and the second due to pulmonary bleed, multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, and cytokine release syndrome. In 51 efficacy-evaluable patients (36 with B-cell lymphoma and 15 with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia), the overall response rate was 73% (37 of 51; 95% CI 59-83).

A trend toward an increased DFS event rate after completion of 3 years adjuvant treatment in ADAURA suggests that some patients may benefit from longer adjuvant osimertinib treatment. We therefore explored whether tumor-informed, circulating tumor DNA-based, molecular residual disease (MRD) could predict recurrence in an exploratory post hoc analysis of 220 patients (n = 112 osimertinib; n = 108 placebo) from ADAURA. MRD preceded imaging DFS events in this study by a median of 4.7 (95% confidence interval, 2.2-5.6) months. DFS and MRD event-free rate at 36 months was 86% versus 36% for patients in the osimertinib versus placebo groups (hazard ratio, 0.23 (95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.36)). In the osimertinib group, DFS or MRD events were detected in 28 (25%) patients; most events occurred following osimertinib cessation (19 of 28, 68%) and within 12 months of stopping osimertinib (11 of 19, 58%). At 24 months after osimertinib, the DFS and MRD event-free rate was 66%. In this study, MRD preceded DFS events in most patients across both arms. DFS and MRD event-free status was maintained for most patients during adjuvant osimertinib treatment and posttreatment follow-up, with most MRD or DFS events occurring after osimertinib treatment discontinuation or completion.

Clusters fall into two types: ""non-diabetogenic hyperinsulinemia,"" where clusters are not associated with increased T2D risk, and ""diabetogenic hyperinsulinemia,"" where T2D associations are driven by body fat distribution, liver function, circulating lipids, or inflammation. In over 1.1 million multi-ancestry individuals, we demonstrated that diabetogenic hyperinsulinemia cluster-specific polygenic scores exhibit varying risks for cardiovascular conditions, including coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke. Notably, the visceral adiposity cluster shows sex-specific effects for MI risk in males without T2D. This study underscores processes that decouple elevated FI levels from T2D and cardiovascular risk, offering new avenues for investigating process-specific pathways of disease.",30/04/2024,Nature communications

In phase 1 of the MonumenTAL-1 study, initial results of subcutaneous talquetamab 0·4 mg/kg once a week and 0·8 mg/kg every 2 weeks showed preliminary clinical activity. We describe safety and activity results in patients treated with talquetamab, including patients who had received previous T-cell redirection therapy (TCR). This post-hoc analysis was done with more mature median follow-up to evaluate duration of response in patients treated with talquetamab 0·8 mg/kg every 2 weeks. METHODS: MonumenTAL-1 is a multicentre, open-label, phase 1-2 study of talquetamab, phase 1 of which has previously been published. The 0·4 mg/kg once a week and 0·8 mg/kg every 2 weeks recommended subcutaneous doses identified in phase 1 were evaluated in phase 2 in patients who were 18 years of age or older, had at least three previous lines of therapy, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2, and were naive or exposed to previous TCR. The primary endpoint was overall response rate assessed by independent review committee in all patients who received at least one dose of talquetamab. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of talquetamab. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03399799 (phase 1) and NCT04634552 (phase 2). FINDINGS: Between Jan 3, 2018, and Feb 20, 2023, 735 patients were screened across all phase 1-2 cohorts. Of these, 537 patients screened for inclusion were treated across phase 1 and 2 cohorts, of whom 1983 (27%) patients were excluded from the study, most commonly due to not meeting eligibility criteria or not having measurable disease. As of Oct 11, 2023, 375 patients had received recommended talquetamab doses across three groups: 143 (0·4 mg/kg once a week group) and 154 (0·8 mg/kg every 2 weeks group) TCR-naive patients and 78 with previous TCR who received either recommended dose (previous TCR group). 217 (58%) of 375 patients were male and 158 (42%) were female. 325 (87%) of 375 patients were White and 32 (9%) patients were Black. Median follow-up was 25·6 months (IQR 8·5-25·9) in the 0·4 mg/kg once a week group, 19·4 months (9·2-20·7) in the 0·8 mg/kg every 2 weeks group, and 16·8 months (7·6-18·7) in the previous TCR group. Overall response rate was 74% (106 of 143 patients, 95% CI 66-81) in the 0·4 mg/kg once a week group, 69% (107 of 154 patients, 62-77) in the 0·8 mg/kg every 2 weeks group, and 67% (52 of 78 patients, 55-77) in the previous TCR group. Most common adverse events in the 0·4 mg/kg once a week, 0·8 mg/kg every 2 weeks, and previous TCR groups were cytokine release syndrome (113 [79%] of 143 patients, 115 [75%] of 154 patients, and 57 [73%] of 78 patients), taste changes (103 [72%], 110 [71%], and 59 [76%]), and infections (85 [59%], 105 [68%], and 59 [76%]). Most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (44 [31%], 33 [21%], and 37 [47%]), anaemia (45 [31%], 40 [26%], and 21 [27%]), and lymphopenia (37 [26%], 40 [26%], and 13 [17%]). Fatal adverse events occurred in five patients in the 0·4 mg/kg once a week group, seven patients in the 0·8 mg/kg every 2 weeks group, and no patients in the previous TCR group; none were related to treatment. INTERPRETATION: Talquetamab continued to demonstrate high overall response rates in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma with longer follow-up in this post-hoc analysis. Overall response rate was promising in patients with previous TCR, including therapies targeting BCMA. On-target, off-tumour adverse events were common but led to few treatment discontinuations.

While data pertaining to the efficacy and toxicity associated with CAR-T have been widely reported, there are limited data on long-term complications. We retrospectively analyzed 246 patients treated with CAR-T for R/R B-cell lymphoma (n = 228) and MM (n = 18) at Ohio State University from 2016 to 2022, with a minimum of two years of follow-up. The median age was 66 years, and the median number of prior treatments was four. With a median follow-up of 38 months (range 11-66), 21 patients (8.5%) developed a second primary malignancy (SPM), with non-melanoma skin cancer being the most common (52%), followed by hematologic malignancies (33%) and non-skin solid tumors (14%). Squamous cell carcinoma accounted for 38% of skin cancers, while myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia were the predominant hematologic malignancies. Solid tumors included bladder, prostate, and breast cancer. The distinct pattern of SPMs suggests potential CAR-T-related risks, warranting vigilant post-treatment surveillance.

We compared the efficacy and safety of ivonescimab with pembrolizumab in patients with programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer. METHODS: HARMONi-2 is a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial across 55 hospitals in China. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had locally advanced or metastatic PD-L1-positive non-small cell lung cancer without sensitising epidermal growth factor receptor mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase translocations and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance-status of 0 or 1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 20 mg/kg ivonescimab or 200 mg pembrolizumab intravenously every 3 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by histology, clinical stage, and PD-L1 expression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by a masked independent radiographic review committee per RECIST v1.1 in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05499390; recruitment is complete, with the trial ongoing and final analysis to be reported later. FINDINGS: Between Nov 9, 2022, and Aug 26, 2023, 398 (45%) of 879 screened patients were randomly assigned to receive ivonescimab (n=198) or pembrolizumab (n=200). At the preplanned interim analysis, median PFS was significantly longer with ivonescimab than with pembrolizumab (11·1 vs 5·8 months; stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0·51 [95% CI 0·38-0·69]; one-sided p<0·0001). The PFS benefit of ivonescimab over pembrolizumab was broadly consistent within prespecified subgroups, including patients with PD-L1 tumour proportion score (TPS) 1-49% (HR 0·54 [95% CI 0·37-0·78]) and PD-L1 TPS of 50% of higher (HR 0·48 [0·29-0·79]). Grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events occurred in 58 (29%) patients with ivonescimab and 31 (16%) patients with pembrolizumab. Immune-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were observed in 14 (7%) of 197 patients on ivonescimab and 16 (8%) of 199 patients on pembrolizumab. Ivonescimab demonstrated a manageable safety profile in patients with both squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. In patients with squamous cell carcinoma, grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events were comparable between the two groups. INTERPRETATION: Ivonescimab significantly improved PFS compared with pembrolizumab in previously untreated patients with advanced PD-L1 positive non-small cell lung cancer. Therefore, ivonescimab might represent another treatment option in the first-line setting for PD-L1-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

The discovery set includes 62 patients, with 62 baseline and 53 post-CRT plasma samples. PET/CT is performed at baseline, and 33 patients undergo mid-treatment scans after 40 Gy. Baseline ctDNA is detected in 71.0% of patients. Pre-treatment ctDNA concentration correlates with total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV) (p < 0.001) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) (p = 0.001) but not treatment response or survival. However, patients with undetectable ctDNA and low TMTV show significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) (34.2 vs 10.1 months, p = 0.027). Post-CRT, ctDNA is detected in 47.2% of patients, while ctDNA concentration (p = 0.005) and variant allele frequency (VAF) (p = 0.005) significantly decline. Undetectable post-CRT ctDNA associates with longer PFS (p < 0.001) and overall survival (OS) (p = 0.001). Higher ∆TMTV correlates with improved PFS and OS. Similar findings were obtained in a test of 19 patients. These results highlight post-CRT ctDNA and ∆TMTV as robust prognostic markers, potentially identifying patients who may forgo ICI consolidation.",27/02/2025,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)"

The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of extended prophylaxis after major abdominopelvic surgery for the prevention of clinically relevant venous thromboembolism after hospital discharge. METHODS: CArdiovaSCulAr outcomes after major abDominal surgEry (CASCADE) was a prospective, international, cohort study into which consecutive adult patients undergoing major abdominopelvic surgery were enrolled (January-May 2022). Extended prophylaxis was considered at least 28 days of anticoagulant prescription after surgery. The primary efficacy outcome was clinically relevant venous thromboembolism and the primary safety outcome was clinically relevant bleeding within 30 days after surgery (European Medicines Agency definitions). The independent association of these outcomes with extended prophylaxis was explored using mixed-effects logistic regression and propensity score weighting. RESULTS: A total of 11 571 patients (median age of 58.0 years; 6399 (55.3%) women) from 29 countries were included. The extended prophylaxis prescription rate was 31.7% (3670 patients). The post-discharge venous thromboembolism and bleeding rates were 0.1% (12 patients) and 0.7% (85 patients) respectively. After weighting, extended prophylaxis was not significantly associated with increased bleeding risk (OR 1.07 (95% c.i. 0.64 to 1.81); P = 0.792) or decreased venous thromboembolism incidence, both in the overall cohort (OR 1.13 (95% c.i. 0.33 to 3.90); P = 0.848) and in a subgroup analysis of patients undergoing complex major surgery and with active cancer (OR: 1.36 (95% c.i. 0.33 to 5.57); P = 0.669). CONCLUSION: In modern practice, the incidence of postoperative venous thromboembolism is low. Extended prophylaxis appears safe, yet the clinical efficacy remains uncertain.

10.1007/s13304-025-02139-8,Current state-of-the-art of adrenal surgery in Italy: the cancer risk in surgical adrenal lesions (CRISAL) survey.,"Corallino, Diletta,Passera, Roberto,Inama, Marco","Adrenalectomies are growing worldwide because of the frequent diagnosis of incidentaloma and the use of minimally invasive surgery (MIS). The factors used to identify a malignant lesion and the best surgical technique are uncertain. In this context, the definition of high-volume center and expert surgeon is under debate. The Italian Society of Endoscopic Surgery and New Technologies (SICE) developed a nationwide survey to investigate the state-of-the-art of adrenal surgery in Italy. A web-based survey comprising 37 questions was developed and distributed to Italian surgeons involved in adrenal surgery. Two hundred forty-eight answers were analyzed. Consensus was reached among the survey participants regarding local infiltration (83%) and rapid growth of the lesion (81%) as markers of malignancy. Nearly 30% of the participants used MIS in case of malignant adrenal lesions. The lateral (50%) and anterior transperitoneal (44%) approaches were the most common among Italian surgeons. Approximately 40% of participants believe that 20-40 adrenalectomies/year are needed to define an expert surgeon and at least 20 procedures/year to define a high-volume center. Approximately half of participants performed < 10 adrenalectomies/year in centers with a median volume < 10 procedures/year. Based on participant feedback, this survey highlights local infiltration and rapid growth as the most significant markers of malignant adrenal lesions. While open adrenalectomy remains the gold standard for suspected malignant lesions, nearly 30% of the participants practice MIS even in these cases. The lateral and anterior transperitoneal approaches emerge as the most familiar for Italian surgeons. A substantial proportion of Italian patients with adrenal lesions undergo surgery performed by surgeons with an annual case volume < 10 procedures, at centers with a low annual volume of adrenalectomies. Moreover, there is a lack of standardized definitions for 'expert surgeon' and 'high-volume center' in this context.",18/11/2024,Updates in surgery

METHOD: We integrated genomic and transcriptomic data to identify therapeutic targets for IPF. First, we conducted a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) using the Omnibus Transcriptome Test using Expression Reference Summary data (OTTERS) framework, combining plasma expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data with IPF Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) summary statistics from the Global Biobank (discovery) and Finngen (duplication). We then applied Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore causal relationships. RNA-seq co-expression analysis (bulk, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics) was used to identify critical genes, followed by molecular docking to evaluate their druggability. Finally, phenome-wide MR (PheW-MR) using GWAS data from 679 diseases in the UK Biobank assessed the potential adverse effects of the identified genes. RESULT: We identified 696 genes associated with IPF in the discovery dataset and 986 genes in the duplication dataset, with 126 overlapping genes through TWAS. MR analysis revealed 29 causal genes in the discovery dataset, with 13 linked to increased and 16 to decreased IPF risk. Summary data-based MR (SMR) confirmed six essential genes: ANO9, BRCA1, CCDC200, EZH1, FAM13A, and SFR1. Bulk RNA-seq showed FAM13A upregulation and SFR1 and EZH1 downregulation in IPF. Single-cell RNA-seq revealed gene expression changes across cell types. Molecular docking identified binding solid affinities for essential genes with respiratory drugs, and PheW-MR highlighted potential side effects. CONCLUSION: We identified six key genes-ANO9, BRCA1, CCDC200, EZH1, FAM13A, and SFR1-as potential drug targets for IPF. Molecular docking revealed strong drug affinities, while PheW-MR analysis highlighted therapeutic potential and associated risks. These findings offer new insights for IPF treatment and further investigation of potential side effects.",13/12/2024,Journal of translational medicine

Here we report the findings from a large-scale, global, multicenter, phase 1 trial evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of YL201 in patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard therapies. The trial included a dose-escalation part (phase 1) and a dose-expansion part (phase 1b). A total of 312 patients were enrolled across multiple tumor types, including extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and other solid tumors. The maximum tolerated dose was determined to be 2.8 mg kg(-1), and the recommended expansion dose was selected as 2.0 mg kg(-1) and 2.4 mg kg(-1) every 3 weeks. The most common grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events included neutropenia (31.7%), leukopenia (29.5%) and anemia (25.0%). Only 4 cases of interstitial lung disease (1.3%) and 1 case of infusion reactions (0.3%) were observed.

By analyzing 6.4 million cells, we reveal that ESCC progression is driven by a proliferative epithelial cell subpopulation that acquires dedifferentiated and invasive characteristics. At the late precancerous stage, these cells disrupt the epithelial-stromal interface and recruit normal fibroblasts via JAG1-NOTCH1 signaling, transforming them into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). This interaction leads to the formation of a ""CAF-Epi"" (CAF and epithelial cell) niche at the tumor edge that shields the tumor from immune surveillance.

Dysregulation of ferroptosis is closely associated with HCC. However, the effect of the epigenetic mRNA m5C modification on ferroptosis in HCC remains unclear. METHODS: In this study, ferroptosis was evaluated by detecting lipid reactive oxygen species (lipid ROS), ferrous ion and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in xenograft mouse model, diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-initiated HCC model and so forth. The regulatory mechanisms of YBX1 in mRNA translation were elucidated using RNA sequencing, ribosome sequencing, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP)-sequencing, bisulphite sequencing and immunoprecipitation (IP)-mass spectrometry assays. Dual-luciferase reporter, RIP-qPCR, Co-IP, RNA pulldown and methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP)-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays were performed to validate the mechanism of YBX1 in regulating mRNA translation by m5C modification. RESULTS: Here, we found that YBX1 promoted the translation of Ring Finger Protein 115 (RNF115) mRNA through m5C modification, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis and promoting HCC development. Moreover, RNF115 was identified as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), promoting Lys27 (K27) ubiquitination and inhibiting its autophagic degradation to counteract ferroptosis. In addition, YBX1 bound to the m5C modification sites of RNF115 3'-untranslated region (UTR) and interacted with Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 4A1 (EIF4A1) to bridge the 5'-UTR regions, promoting mRNA circularisation and translation, while NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 2 (NSUN2) was identified as responsible for m5C modification of RNF115 mRNA in HCC. CONCLUSIONS: The current work revealed that YBX1 promoted RNF115 mRNA translation in an m5C-dependent manner, thereby regulating DHODH ubiquitination and expression to suppress ferroptosis. This research sheds light on the mechanism of YBX1 in m5C-modified mRNAs translation and ferroptosis, highlighting its promise as a biomarker for prognosis and a target for therapy in HCC. KEY POINTS: YBX1 inhibits ferroptosis in HCC by regulating the RNF115-DHODH axis. RNF115, an E3 ligase, mediates K27 ubiquitination and autophagic degradation of DHODH. YBX1 binds to the m5C sites of RNF115 mRNA 3'-UTR and interacts with EIF4A1 to bridge the 5'-UTR, promoting mRNA circularisation and translation. High expression of YBX1/RNF115 predicts the poor overall survival in HCC.",25/02/2025,Clinical and translational medicine

To date, the understanding of the molecular and genomic heterogeneity of HGSC is based primarily on the evaluation of tumors from White individuals. In the present study, we performed whole exome sequencing on HGSC samples from 211 Black patients to identify significantly mutated genes and characterize mutational signatures, assessing their distributions by gene expression subtypes. The occurrence and frequency of somatic mutations and signatures by self-reported race were compared to historical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Despite technical differences (e.g., formalin-fixed vs. fresh-frozen tissue), the distribution of mutations and their variant classifications for major HGSC genes were nearly identical across study populations. However, de novo significantly mutated gene analysis identified genes not previously reported in the TCGA analysis, including the oncogene KRAS and the potential tumor suppressor OBSCN. The prevalence of the homologous recombination deficiency signature was higher among Black individuals with the immunoreactive gene expression subtype compared with the mesenchymal and proliferative subtypes. These findings were confirmed by comparing the data from Black patients to 123 White patients with identical tissue collection and processing. Overall, this study suggests that, while most features of HGSC tumor phenotypes are similar in Black and White populations, there may be clinically-relevant differences. If validated, these phenotypes may be important for clinical decision-making and would have been missed by characterizing tumors from White individuals only.",07/02/2025,Cancer research

Around 7 in 10 adults with RMD live overweight or with obesity. Obesity not only increases the risk of developing RMDs. It worsens disease activity, pain, and fatigue; impairs treatment responses; and thereby reduces quality of life and physical function. Further, obesity can amplify or drive several comorbidities that are more prevalent in RMDs including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. Moreover, reciprocal risk arises since RMDs make it harder to be physically active and maintain a healthy weight, especially in the context of an obesogenic environment. In this viewpoint, we review relevant evidence to suggest obesity confers distinctive, important challenges in care and daily living for many patients with RMDs. With the advent of several highly effective drugs for obesity, we also highlight research needs including that for robust clinical trials to test the efficacy and effectiveness of these therapies as part of the management of inflammatory RMDs, as primary agent or adjuvant to immune targeted therapeutics. Implementing such weight management strategies should provide a much-needed holistic approach to the care of our patients.",25/11/2024,Annals of the rheumatic diseases

We aimed to develop and validate a deep learning-based early recurrence predictive model (ERPM) and a treatment response predictive model (TRPM) on whole slide images to assist clinical decision making. METHODS: In this retrospective, multicentre study, we included consecutive patients with pathology-confirmed NMIBC who underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumour from five centres. Patients from one hospital (Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China) were assigned to training and internal validation cohorts, and patients from four other hospitals (the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, and Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China; the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, China; Shenshan Medical Centre, Shanwei, China) were assigned to four independent external validation cohorts. Based on multi-instance and ensemble learning, the ERPM was developed to make predictions on haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry staining slides. Sharing the same architecture of the ERPM, the TRPM was trained and evaluated by cross validation on patients who received Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). The performance of the ERPM was mainly evaluated and compared with the clinical model, H&E-based model, and integrated model through the area under the curve. Survival analysis was performed to assess the prognostic capability of the ERPM. FINDINGS: Between January 1, 2017, and September 30, 2023, 4395 whole slide images of 1275 patients were included to train and validate the models. The ERPM was superior to the clinical and H&E-based model in predicting early recurrence in both internal validation cohort (area under the curve: 0.837 vs 0.645 vs 0.737) and external validation cohorts (area under the curve: 0.761-0.802 vs 0.626-0.682 vs 0.694-0.723) and was on par with the integrated model. It also stratified recurrence-free survival significantly (p < 0.0001) with a hazard ratio of 4.50 (95% CI 3.10-6.53). The TRPM performed well in predicting BCG-unresponsive NMIBC (accuracy 84.1%). INTERPRETATION: The ERPM showed promising performance in predicting early recurrence and recurrence-free survival of patients with NMIBC after surgery and with further validation and in combination with TRPM could be used to guide the management of NMIBC.

It will evaluate the feasibility of NHHR as a tool for predicting CKM syndrome and offer valuable insights for personalized treatment approaches within the U.S. population. METHODS: Data from 16,575 individuals aged 20 to 69 years were analyzed, having excluded those who were pregnant and individuals with incomplete data. CKM syndrome was characterized by the simultaneous presence of CKD and Cardiometabolic Syndrome (CMS). For the statistical analysis, weighted logistic regression models were applied, accounting for variables such as age, gender, ethnicity, educational background, marital status, lifestyle factors, and preexisting health conditions. Differently, restricted cubic splines (RCS) were applied to investigate any possible nonlinear relationships between NHHR and CKM in the study. RESULTS: The research revealed that the occurrence of CKM syndrome was more prevalent among individuals aged 60 and older, with women representing 55.36% of those affected. Additionally, NHHR levels were notably elevated in CKM patients when compared to those without CKM (p < 0.0001). As NHHR increased, the prevalence of CKM also rose, with the highest prevalence in the highest NHHR quartile (Q4: 36.06%). A positive connection between NHHR and CKM was indicated by multivariable logistic regression, especially in the upper quartiles of NHHR (Q3 and Q4). Moreover, RCS analysis displayed a noteworthy nonlinear connection between NHHR and CKM occurrence. The subgroup analysis uncovered significant interactions influenced by BMI and Hypertension. CONCLUSION: With the rising global prevalence of CKM syndrome, early identification of high-risk individuals using NHHR could inform targeted prevention and intervention strategies. Future research should focus on validating NHHR in diverse populations and exploring its clinical utility, as well as examining its relationship with other biomarkers of metabolic dysfunction to better understand CKM syndrome's complex pathophysiology.",20/12/2024,Frontiers in nutrition

This barrier has a central role in regulating the controlled interaction between luminal factors and the intestinal immune system. Disruptions of intestinal epithelial cells, which serve as a physical barrier, or the antimicrobial peptides and mucins they produce, which act as a chemical barrier, can lead to a leaky gut. In this state, the intestinal wall is unable to efficiently separate the intestinal flora and luminal contents from the intestinal immune system. The subsequent activation of the immune system has an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, as well as in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and colorectal cancer. Dysregulated intestinal barrier integrity has also been described in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases outside the gastrointestinal tract, including rheumatoid arthritis and neurodegenerative disorders. Mechanistic studies of barrier dysfunction have revealed that the subsequent local activation and systemic circulation of activated immune cells and the cytokines they secrete, as well as extracellular vesicles, promote proinflammatory processes within and outside the gastrointestinal tract. In this Review, we summarise these findings and highlight several new therapeutic concepts currently being developed that attempt to control inflammatory processes via direct or indirect modulation of intestinal barrier function.",26/09/2024,The lancet.

10.1001/jama.2025.0220,Chronic Myeloid Leukemia: A Review.,"Jabbour, Elias,Kantarjian, Hagop","IMPORTANCE: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has an annual incidence of 2 cases per 100 000 people and is newly diagnosed in approximately 9300 individuals per year in the US. Approximately 150 000 people in the US and 5 million worldwide have CML. OBSERVATIONS: Chronic myeloid leukemia is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, which is defined by the BCR::ABL1 oncogene that develops after fusion of the ABL1 proto-oncogene to the constitutively active BCR gene. Approximately 90% of people with CML present with an indolent chronic phase of CML, defined as blasts of less than 10% in the blood or bone marrow, absence of extramedullary evidence of leukemia, basophils of less than 20%, and platelet counts of 100 to 1000 × 109/L. The most advanced stage is CML blastic phase (CML-BP), characterized by the World Health Organization as 20% or more blasts/immature cells and by the MD Anderson Cancer Center and European LeukemiaNet as 30% or more. Approximately 1% to 2% of patients with CML present with CML-BP. Since 2000, first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting BCR::ABL1, such as imatinib, and second-generation TKIs, such as bosutinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib, have improved CML-related mortality from 10% to 20% per year to 1% to 2% per year, such that patients with CML have survival rates similar to those of a general age-matched population. Six BCR::ABL1 TKIs have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, including 5 that are first-line treatment (imatinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, nilotinib, and asciminib) and 5 approved for treatment after disease progression despite initial therapy (dasatinib, bosutinib, nilotinib, ponatinib, asciminib). Effects on improved survival are similar with all TKIs, although more patients are able to promptly achieve and maintain BCR::ABL1 clearance with second- and third-generation TKIs. Medication adherence is important to maintain treatment responsiveness. All TKIs are associated with hematologic toxicity, such as myelosuppression, with additional agent-specific adverse effects, such as pleural effusion (dasatinib), arterio-occlusive events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral artery disease (nilotinib, ponatinib), gastrointestinal disturbance (bosutinib), or increased amylase and lipase with pancreatitis (ponatinib, asciminib, nilotinib). These adverse effects should be considered when selecting a TKI. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant is a reasonably safe therapy, with cure rates ranging from 20% to 60% based on the stage of CML at the time of transplant. Stem cell transplant is reserved for patients with CML who do not respond to second-generation TKIs, those with intolerance to multiple TKIs, or those with accelerated-phase CML or CML-BP. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Chronic myeloid leukemia is a myeloproliferative neoplasm that can typically be effectively treated with TKIs, improving survival similar to that of a general age-matched population. Many patients require continuous TKI therapy. Therefore, TKI therapy should be selected with consideration of adverse effects, and patients should be helped to maximize adherence to TKI treatment.",17/03/2025,JAMA

However, its function in preimplantation embryonic development and its potential involvement in epigenetic regulation remain poorly understood. In this study, it is shown that MFN1 interacts with PADI6, a key component of the cytoplasmic lattice in oocytes and early embryos. MFN1 deficiency in mice results in reduced PADI6 levels and decreased expression of translational machinery components, which suppress protein synthesis activity and lower histone H3.3 abundance. These disruptions lead to the failure of male pronucleus formation, aberrant zygotic genome activation, and impaired embryonic development. It is further demonstrated that the MFN1 activator S89 promotes H3.3 incorporation and rescues early development in maternally aged embryos with low MFN1 levels. Additionally, a positive correlation between MFN1 and H3.3 protein levels in early human embryos is observed. Together, these findings provide new insights into MFN1's role in regulating epigenetic reprogramming during preimplantation embryo development.",07/02/2025,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)"

Oral mizoribine may be an alternative for induction therapy of lupus nephritis. However, large-scale, long-term, randomized clinical studies of mizoribine are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of oral mizoribine vs intravenous cyclophosphamide as induction therapy for Chinese patients with lupus nephritis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective, multicenter, parallel-group, open-label, phase 3 randomized clinical trial recruited patients with class III, III+V, IV, IV+V, or V lupus nephritis aged 18 to 70 years from 40 centers in China. Inclusion criteria included 24-hour urinary protein level of 1.0 g or higher and systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index of 8 or higher. The first patient was enrolled on November 29, 2014, and the study finished March 14, 2019. The follow-up period was 52 weeks. Data were analyzed from September 4, 2019, to January 21, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Oral mizoribine (50 mg, 3 times a day) or cyclophosphamide (6 intravenous doses at 0.5-1.0 g/m2 body surface area, with a maximum dose of 1.0 g/d) for 52 weeks plus oral glucocorticoid. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Total remission rate (complete remission rate plus partial remission rate) after 52 weeks (prespecified). RESULTS: A total of 250 patients were randomized, and 243 patients (mean [SD] age, 34.6 [10.7] years, 213 women [87.7%]) were treated (123 patients [50.6%] in the mizoribine group and 120 patients [49.4%] in the cyclophosphamide group). The total remission rate at 52 weeks was 66.1% (76 of 115 patients) in the mizoribine group and 76.8% (86 of 112 patients) in the cyclophosphamide group, and the relative risk ratio (mizoribine vs cyclophosphamide) was 0.861 (95% CI, 0.729-1.016). The lower limit of this 2-sided 95% CI was greater than the noninferiority margin of 0.726, indicating that mizoribine was noninferior to cyclophosphamide. Changes in other immune parameters and kidney function were generally similar between the groups. The incidence of any treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events was 80.5% (99 of 123 patients) in the mizoribine group and 78.7% (96 of 122 patients) in the cyclophosphamide group, and the most frequent adverse event in both groups was upper respiratory tract infection (41 patients [33.3%] and 37 patients [30.3%], respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial shows that compared with intravenous cyclophosphamide, oral mizoribine was noninferior and well tolerated when used with glucocorticoid for induction therapy of active lupus nephritis. Mizoribine can be used as an alternative to intravenous cyclophosphamide as induction therapy for lupus nephritis.

Whereas IF involves cyclic metabolic switching (CMS) between ketogenic and non-ketogenic states, KDs and CR may not. In this Perspective, I postulate that the beneficial effects of IF result from alternating between activation of adaptive cellular stress response pathways during the fasting period, followed by cell growth and plasticity pathways during the feeding period. Thereby, I establish the cyclic metabolic switching (CMS) theory of IF. The health benefits of IF may go beyond those seen with continuous CR or KDs without CMS owing to the unique interplay between the signalling functions of the ketone β-hydroxybutyrate, mitochondrial adaptations, reciprocal activation of autophagy and mTOR pathways, endocrine and paracrine signalling, gut microbiota, and circadian biology. The CMS theory may have important implications for future basic research, clinical trials, development of pharmacological interventions, and healthy lifestyle practices.",25/09/2024,Nature metabolism

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that maternal WD accelerates atherogenesis in adult offspring mice by regulating chromatin dynamics through activator protein-1 (AP-1) in aortic ECs, inducing inflammatory memory at the chromatin level. We found that 27-hydroxycholesterol is involved in memory establishment and also acts as a secondary stimulator, amplifying the expression of inflammatory factors and enhancing the enrichment of AP-1/p300 and H3K27ac in ECs. Inhibiting AP-1 binding to chromatin reduced the inflammatory response in human umbilical vein ECs from mothers with hypercholesterolemia and decreased atherogenesis in offspring mice exposed to maternal WD. Our findings demonstrate that maternal WD exacerbates EC dysfunction and atherosclerosis in adult offspring by inducing AP-1-associated epigenetic memory, which increases chromatin accessibility to inflammatory genes.",04/07/2024,Nature cardiovascular research

This evolutionary process has been particularly vivid in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), as this cancer and associated precursor lesions, including Barrett's esophagus (BE), low-grade dysplasia (LGD), and high-grade dysplasia (HGD), co-exist in an accessible, two-dimensional pattern in esophageal mucosa. Given the durability of these precursor lesions, it is likely that they, like EAC, rely on stem cells for their regenerative growth. To assess the role of stem cells in the evolution of EAC, we apply technology that selectively clones stem cells from the gastrointestinal tract to patient-matched endoscopic biopsies from each of the precursor lesions implicated in EAC. METHODS: Histologically validated, endoscopic biopsy series including EAC, HGD, LGD, BE, and normal esophageal mucosa were obtained from patients presenting with EAC. Rare (1:1,000) cells from each of these lesions proved clonogenic and were assessed by in vitro differentiation, tumorigenicity in mice, and by molecular genetics. RESULTS: Each of the lesions in the evolution of EAC possess a discrete set of clonogenic cells marked by immaturity, enormous proliferative potential, and lesion-specific differentiation fate. DNA sequencing of these clones reveal intralesional heterogeneity and clonal resolution of the mutation progression within a given patient from BE, LGD, HGD, and EAC. High-throughput chemical screens against BE stem cells reveal drug combinations that are similarly effective against stem cells of LDG, HGD, and EAC.

Western Blot (WB), Immunofluorescence (IF), and real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) assay for fibroblast activation markers and glycolysis-related genes in lung tissues. The Lactic Acid (LA) Content Assay Kit was employed to quantify lactate concentrations in lung tissues and fibroblast cultures. Immunoprecipitation (IP) was applied to detect lactylated modified protein levels, and mass spectrometry (MS) was used to analyze lactate substrate profiles in fibroblasts. WB was employed to detect the lactate modification level of histone H3K18 (H3K18la). The targets of ECC-JHF were analyzed using network pharmacology, while molecular docking and cellular enthusiasm transfer analysis (CETSA) examined the binding of ECC-JHF to SRC. The influence of ECC-JHF on SRC activation was assessed using WB. SRC small interfering RNA (siSRC) was designed and transfected into L929 cells to validate the function of SRC in the inhibition of fibroblast activation by ECC-JHF. RESULTS: In BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis mice, ECC-JHF significantly reduced alveolar inflammation and collagen deposition. In lung tissues and fibroblasts, ECC-JHF notably inhibited the expression of HK2, lactate levels, and lactylated modifying proteins. IP-MS and WB analyses showed that ECC-JHF significantly reduced H3K18la levels. Network pharmacology analysis, molecular docking and CETSA results indicated that SRC serves as a key target for ECC-JHF. siSRC effectively mitigated the impact of ECC-JHF on the expression of HK2, levels of H3K18la, and the activation of fibroblasts. CONCLUSION: ECC-JHF may improve pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting SRC activation, blocking HK2-mediated lactate production, down-regulating H3K18la levels, and inhibiting fibroblast activation. Our results serve as a significant reference for the advancement of ECC-JHF and the exploration of IPF.",04/09/2024,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology

However, the underlying mechanisms governing mitochondrial self-renewal and energy production remain elusive. In this study, we demonstrated mitochondrial damage and aberrant mitophagy in OA chondrocytes. Genetically overexpressing PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) protects against cartilage degeneration by removing defective mitochondria. PINK1 knockout aggravated cartilage damage due to impaired mitophagy. SIRT3 directly deacetylated PINK1 to promote mitophagy and cartilage anabolism. Specifically, PINK1 phosphorylated PKM2 at the Ser127 site, preserving its active tetrameric form. This inhibited nuclear translocation and the interaction with β-catenin, resulting in a metabolic shift and increased energy production. Finally, a double-knockout mouse model demonstrated the role of the SIRT3-PINK1-PKM2 axis in safeguarding the structural integrity of articular joints and improving motor functions. Overall, this study provides a novel insight into the regulation of mitochondrial renewal and metabolic switches in OA.",19/08/2024,Bone research

Sex hormones are mainly produced in the gonads, but evidence suggests that they can also be locally synthesised in skeletal muscle. However, little is known about the purpose of intramuscular sex hormones and their role in skeletal muscle. This systematic review aimed to investigate 1) how intramuscular sex hormone concentrations vary across the lifespan, 2) whether exercise affects intramuscular sex hormone concentrations, and 3) whether intramuscular sex hormones are associated with skeletal muscle mass and function. METHODS: Four databases were searched, and studies were included if they contained measurements of intramuscular sex hormones from healthy males and females free from any hormonal treatment or from rodents. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included. Intramuscular testosterone was reduced in older males compared to their younger counterparts, but comparison of intramuscular sex hormone concentrations between pre- and post-menopausal females yielded inconclusive findings. Chronic exercise decreased androgens and oestradiol in females, but increased androgens in males. Acute exercise did not change intramuscular hormone concentrations in humans but increased them in rodents. Intramuscular androgens were positively associated with muscle mass and strength in males. In females, conflicting findings were reported for both oestradiol and androgens, and measures of muscle mass and function. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that ageing and exercise differentially modulate intramuscular sex hormone concentrations, and their association with muscle mass and function, between males and females, and model systems.",28/10/2024,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism

10.1016/j.ecoenv.2025.118029,A network toxicology and machine learning approach to investigate the mechanism of kidney injury from melamine and cyanuric acid co-exposure.,"Wang, Zhan,Zhou, Zhaokai,Zhao, Zihao,Zhang, Junjie,Zhang, Shengli,Li, Luping,Fan, Yingzhong,Li, Qi","BACKGROUND: Within the past two decades, high-profile cases of melamine (MA) exposure have raised significant toxicological concerns, particularly regarding food adulteration. While widely used as a fundamental organic chemical intermediate in various household products, MA's potential for unexpected toxicological synergy with its homolog, cyanuric acid (CA), remains a concern. This study aimed to investigate the nephrotoxicity of combined melamine and cyanuric acid (MC) exposure and its underlying mechanisms in rats through an integrative approach, combining network toxicology (NT), bioinformatics, and experimental validation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were exposed to MC at doses of 0/0 mg/kg/day (Control) and 63/63 mg/kg/day (MC) for four weeks. Kidney pathology, injury markers, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes between the two groups. Bioinformatics analysis, including pathway enrichment and immune microenvironment analysis, was conducted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of MC-induced kidney injury. Potential target proteins were identified using ChEMBL, STITCH, and GeneCards databases, and hub genes were screened using three machine learning algorithms: LASSO regression, Random Forest, and Molecular Complex Detection. Molecular docking simulations were performed to assess the interactions between MC and the identified hub genes. RESULTS: MC exposure resulted in severe kidney morphological and histological changes, as well as elevated levels of kidney injury and fibrosis markers. RNA-seq analysis revealed significant enrichment of immuno-inflammatory and apoptosis-related pathways in the MC group. Immune microenvironment analysis confirmed the infiltration of pro-inflammatory immune cells. Network toxicology analysis identified 20 potential targets associated with MC-induced kidney injury. Two hub genes, Ren and Casp3, were identified as key regulators of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation and apoptosis, respectively. Further experimental validation, including Western blotting and immunofluorescence, confirmed the upregulation of these proteins. Molecular docking simulations demonstrated strong binding affinities between MC and the two hub proteins. CONCLUSION: MC exposure induces significant kidney injury and fibrosis. The activation of the RAAS pathway and apoptosis plays a crucial role in MC-mediated nephrotoxicity. However, additional vivo experimental validation is lacking. Future studies should focus on further exploration for the mechanism of MC-induced nephrotoxicity and more rigorous experimental validation.",07/12/2024,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety

However, the role of mitochondrial metabolism in tumor immunity remains unclear. The present study integrates spatial transcriptomics, bulk transcriptomics and proteomics, revealing a strong link between the metabolite succinyl-CoA and tumor immunity as well as the efficacy of anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) therapy in patients with melanoma. Elevated succinyl-CoA levels, through α-ketoglutarate or succinate supplementation, enhanced T cell-mediated tumor elimination, both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, succinylation of the ligand of PD-1 (PD-L1) at lysine 129 led to its degradation. Increased carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), identified as a succinyltransferase for PD-L1, boosted anti-tumor activity. Preclinically, bezafibrate, a hyperlipidemia drug, upregulated CPT1A and synergized with CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody to inhibit tumor growth. Clinically, higher PD-L1 and lower CPT1A levels in tumors correlated with better anti-PD-1 therapy responses, suggesting potential biomarkers for prediction of treatment efficacy.",11/11/2023,Nature genetics
10.1038/s41580-025-00828-1,Nuclear and genome dynamics underlying DNA double-strand break repair.,"Chiolo, Irene,Altmeyer, Matthias,Legube, Gaëlle,Mekhail, Karim","Changes in nuclear shape and in the spatial organization of chromosomes in the nucleus commonly occur in cancer, ageing and other clinical contexts that are characterized by increased DNA damage. However, the relationship between nuclear architecture, genome organization, chromosome stability and health remains poorly defined. Studies exploring the connections between the positioning and mobility of damaged DNA relative to various nuclear structures and genomic loci have revealed nuclear and cytoplasmic processes that affect chromosome stability. In this Review, we discuss the dynamic mechanisms that regulate nuclear and genome organization to promote DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, genome stability and cell survival. Genome dynamics that support DSB repair rely on chromatin states, repair-protein condensates, nuclear or cytoplasmic microtubules and actin filaments, kinesin or myosin motor proteins, the nuclear envelope, various nuclear compartments, chromosome topology, chromatin loop extrusion and diverse signalling cues. These processes are commonly altered in cancer and during natural or premature ageing. Indeed, the reshaping of the genome in nuclear space during DSB repair points to new avenues for therapeutic interventions that may take advantage of new cancer cell vulnerabilities or aim to reverse age-associated defects.",21/01/2025,Nature reviews.

The phase 3 LUNA3 study in previously treated adults with persistent/chronic ITP evaluated oral rilzabrutinib 400 mg bid (n=133) vs placebo (n=69) for 24 weeks. At baseline overall, median age was 47 years (range, 18-80), 63% female, 7.7 year (range, 0.3-52.2) median duration of ITP, and 28% were splenectomized. Overall (N=202), 85 (64%) rilzabrutinib and 22 (32%) placebo patients achieved platelet response (≥50×109/L or 30×109/L-<50×109/L and doubled from baseline) during the first 12 weeks and were eligible to complete the double-blind period. The primary endpoint durable platelet response (platelet count ≥50×109/L for ≥two-thirds of ≥8 of the last 12 of 24 weeks without rescue therapy) was observed in 31 (23%) rilzabrutinib vs 0 placebo patients (P<0.0001). All secondary efficacy endpoints were significantly superior for rilzabrutinib (P<0.05). Median time to first platelet response was 15 d in rilzabrutinib responders. Rilzabrutinib significantly reduced rescue therapy use by 52% (P=0.0007) and improved week 25 bleeding scores (P=0.0006). Improved physical fatigue was sustained from week 13 (P=0.01) through 25 (P=0.0003). Treatment-related adverse events were mainly grade 1-2.

Cancer cell-intrinsic features, especially those that can be dynamically monitored via liquid biopsy, represent a broader scope for biomarker development. In addition, a potential mode of ICB resistance is tumor-intrinsic mechanisms leading to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the underlying interactive network remains elusive, and the generalizable biomarkers and targeting strategies are still lacking. Here, we uncovered the potential of plasma S100 calcium-binding protein A1 (S100A1) for determining ICB efficacy via liquid biopsy of patients with lung cancer. Multiomics and functional studies have suggested that tumor-intrinsic S100A1 expression correlated with an immunologically ""cold"" TME and resistance to ICB in multiple syngeneic murine tumors and tissue samples from patients with lung cancer. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that interfering with the tumor-intrinsic S100A1/ubiquitin-specific protease 7/p65/granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) modulatory axis could potentiate an inflamed TME by promoting M1-like macrophage polarization and T cell function. GM-CSF priming was sufficient to enhance the ICB response in tumors with high S100A1 expression in preclinical models. These findings define S100A1 as a potential blood-based biomarker and a novel synergistic target for cancer immunotherapy.",06/09/2024,Signal transduction and targeted therapy
10.1186/s13024-025-00819-y,Alzheimer's disease neuropathology and its estimation with fluid and imaging biomarkers.,"Thal, Dietmar Rudolf,Poesen, Koen,Vandenberghe, Rik,De Meyer, Steffi","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is neuropathologically characterized by the extracellular deposition of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and the intraneuronal accumulation of abnormal phosphorylated tau (τ)-protein (p-τ). Most frequently, these hallmark lesions are accompanied by other co-pathologies in the brain that may contribute to cognitive impairment, such as vascular lesions, intraneuronal accumulation of phosphorylated transactive-response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), and/or α-synuclein (αSyn) aggregates. To estimate the extent of these AD and co-pathologies in patients, several biomarkers have been developed. Specific tracers target and visualize Aβ plaques, p-τ and αSyn pathology or inflammation by positron emission tomography. In addition to these imaging biomarkers, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood-based biomarker assays reflecting AD-specific or non-specific processes are either already in clinical use or in development. In this review, we will introduce the pathological lesions of the AD brain, the related biomarkers, and discuss to what extent the respective biomarkers estimate the pathology determined at post-mortem histopathological analysis. It became evident that initial stages of Aβ plaque and p-τ pathology are not detected with the currently available biomarkers. Interestingly, p-τ pathology precedes Aβ deposition, especially in the beginning of the disease when biomarkers are unable to detect it. Later, Aβ takes the lead and accelerates p-τ pathology, fitting well with the known evolution of biomarker measures over time. Some co-pathologies still lack clinically established biomarkers today, such as TDP-43 pathology or cortical microinfarcts. In summary, specific biomarkers for AD-related pathologies allow accurate clinical diagnosis of AD based on pathobiological parameters. Although current biomarkers are excellent measures for the respective pathologies, they fail to detect initial stages of the disease for which post-mortem analysis of the brain is still required. Accordingly, neuropathological studies remain essential to understand disease development especially in early stages. Moreover, there is an urgent need for biomarkers reflecting co-pathologies, such as limbic predominant, age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy-related pathology, which is known to modify the disease by interacting with p-τ. Novel biomarker approaches such as extracellular vesicle-based assays and cryptic RNA/peptides may help to better detect these co-pathologies in the future.",10/07/2024,Molecular neurodegeneration

However, TAT may increase the risk of hemorrhage. There is a dearth of data regarding the risks of bleeding with various oral anticoagulants in TAT in comparison with DAPT and individual anticoagulants and antiplatelets due to which we carried out the present study examining the real-world pharmacovigilance data. METHODS: Data were extracted from the USFDA Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) from March 2004 to June 2024 using the Standardized MedDRA Query (SMQ) code for ""haemorrhages."" We employed the ""case-non-case"" approach in disproportionality analysis to detect safety signals for hemorrhage among anticoagulant, antiplatelet, dual antiplatelet and triple antithrombotic combinations. Reports including combinations of DAPT (acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel) with oral anticoagulants (acenocoumarol, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and warfarin) were analyzed. Signal detection used both frequentist (reporting odds ratio [ROR], proportional reporting ratio and Bayesian (Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network, Multi-Item Gamma Poisson Shrinker algorithms. The lower limit of 95% confidence interval of ROR above 1 indicates higher reporting risk of bleeding. Following outcomes were evaluated for each TAT: death, disability and hospitalization. RESULTS: Of 20,626 unique reports, 812 involved TAT, 3,820 DAPT, and 15,995 individual antiplatelets. Most cases occurred in elderly patients (age ≥ 65 years) with a predominance of male patients. Rivaroxaban combined with DAPT presented the highest hemorrhage signal (ROR: 82.84; 95% CI, 60.77-112.92), while apixaban showed the lowest (ROR: 13.11; 95% CI, 9.39-18.3) and the other anticoagulants are as follows: warfarin (ROR: 15.96; 95% CI: 18.36), dabigatran (ROR: 27.32; 95% CI: 20.03-37.26) and acenocoumarol (ROR: 43.98; 95% CI: 17.21-112.4). Mortality and hospitalization rates varied significantly among treatments, with rivaroxaban linked to the highest mortality. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the elevated hemorrhage risk associated with TAT, particularly with rivaroxaban, while apixaban appears safer in terms of bleeding and mortality. These findings underscore the need for cautious monitoring of bleeding outcomes with anticoagulant regimens, particularly rivaroxaban combinations for optimizing patient outcomes. However, the signals obtained in this study need to be validated in future trials.",05/12/2024,BMC cardiovascular disorders

However, few studies have investigated the correlation between HGI and prognosis in patients with critical ischemic stroke. METHODS: A cohort of patients was established from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Kaplan-Meier analysis, multivariate regression models, and restricted cubic splines (RCS) were used to investigate the associations between HGI and different outcomes. Mediation models were constructed to determine the mediating role of white blood cell (WBC) counts. RESULTS: This study included 2,332 participants. In-hospital mortality differs significantly across HGI groups (24.43 %, 11.82 %, and 10.14 %, P < 0.001). Multivariate regression analyses found that lower HGI was significantly associated with greater mortality risk. Nonlinear analyses revealed an L-shaped association between HGI and short-term mortality (30-day and in-hospital), while a reverse J-shaped relationship emerged for long-term (365-day) mortality. Mediation analysis revealed that WBC counts mediated the association with proportions (%) of 33.73, 19.65, and 30.00, respectively. CONCLUSION: Lower HGI is consistently related to poorer outcomes in patients with critical ischemic stroke. Higher HGI could be a protective factor in the short term but might increase mortality risk in the long term.

We identified a core transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) in HSPC-like blasts that is combinatorically controlled by HOXA/AP1/CEBPA. This TRN signature can predict chemotherapy response and long-term clinical outcomes.

Here, we show that FoxO3 deficiency promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation in postnatal mice and improves cardiac function in homeostatic adult mice. Moreover, FoxO3 deficiency accelerates heart regeneration following injury in postnatal mice at the regenerative and non-regenerative stages. We reveal that FoxO3 directly promotes the expression of secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (Sfrp2) and suppresses the activation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling during heart regeneration. The increased activation of β-catenin in FoxO3-deficient cardiomyocytes can be blocked by Sfrp2 overexpression. In addition, Sfrp2 overexpression suppressed cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration in FoxO3-deficient mice. These findings suggest that FoxO3 negatively controls cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration in postnatal mice at least in part by promoting Sfrp2 expression, which leading to the inactivation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling.",20/05/2024,Nature communications

Gut microbiome as a whole plays a critical role in shaping immune responses and influencing cancer progression. Recent evidence suggests that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), may influence immunotherapy efficacy by modulating the tumor microenvironment. Infection with H. pylori is common as it affects approximately 50% of the global population and remains the leading risk factor for gastric cancer. Interestingly, recent clinical and preclinical data has associated H. pylori with colorectal cancer carcinogenesis. Gut microbiome appears to be a modulator of the relationship between the immune system, gastrointestinal cancer development and existing therapies. Infection with H. pylori may affect immunotherapy results in both gastroesophageal and colorectal cancer; favorable results were noticed in H. pylori positive patients with gastric cancer, while in colorectal cancer patients the pathogen seemed to impede immunotherapy's action.

Anti-ganglioside antibodies are thought to play a key role in the clinical diversity of the disease and can be helpful in clinical practice. Extensive research into clinical associations of individual anti-ganglioside antibody specificities has been performed. Recent research has highlighted glycolipid complexes, glycolipid combinations that may alter antibody binding, as targets. In this study, we investigated antibody reactivity patterns to glycolipids and glycolipid complexes using combinatorial array, in relation to clinical features in Guillain-Barré syndrome. In total, 1413 patients from the observational International Guillain-Barré syndrome Outcome Study (0-91 years, 60.3% male) and 1061 controls (healthy, family, infectious, vaccination, other neurological disease) were included. Acute-phase sera from patients were screened for IgM, IgG, and IgA reactivity against 15 glycolipids and one phospholipid and their heteromeric complexes, similarly to archived control sera. Antibody specificities and reactivity patterns were analysed in relation to clinical features. Of all patients, 1309 (92.6%) were positive for at least one anti-glycolipid (complex) antibody. Anti-GM1 and anti-GQ1b (complex) antibodies best distinguished motor Guillain-Barré syndrome and Miller Fisher syndrome from controls, with antibodies to glycolipid complexes outperforming antibodies to single glycolipids. Three models consisting of anti-glycolipid (complex) antibodies distinguished patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome, the motor variant, and Miller Fisher syndrome from controls with high sensitivity and specificity, performing better than antibodies to single glycolipids used in clinical practice. Seven patient clusters with particular antibody reactivity patterns were identified. These clusters were distinguished by geographical region, clinical variants, preceding Campylobacter jejuni infection, electrophysiological subtypes, the Medical Research Council sum score at study entry, and the ability to walk 10 meters unaided at 26 weeks. Two patient clusters with distinct anti-GM1 (complex) reactivity (broad versus restricted) differed in frequency of the axonal subtype. In cumulative incidence analyses, 15 anti-glycolipid (complex) antibodies were associated with the time required to regain the ability to walk 10 meters unaided. After adjustment for known prognostic factors, IgG anti-GQ1b:GM4, GQ1b:PS, and GQ1b:Sulphatide remained associated with faster recovery. Addition of anti-glycolipid antibodies to clinical prognostic models slightly improved their discriminative capacity, though insufficiently to improve the models. Measurement of anti-glycolipid antibodies by combinatorial array increases the diagnostic yield compared to assaying single glycolipids, identifies clinically relevant antibody reactivity patterns to glycolipids and glycolipid complexes, and may be useful in outcome prediction in Guillain-Barré syndrome.",08/11/2024,Brain : a journal of neurology

We identified microbiome differences in human CAC compared with longstanding inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and sporadic colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Twenty-four CAC resections were matched with CRC and IBD controls. Methods included histopathology, 16S rDNA metagenomics, and pathobiont-specific qPCR. Beta diversity differed by diagnosis (PERMANOVA p = 0.007). The distinguishing taxa included Akkermansia enriched in CRC, and Bacteroides spp. enriched in IBD. The non-neoplastic mucosae presented distinct beta diversity (p = 0.005), but the CAC/CRC tumor microbiomes were similar (p = 0.7). Within metastases and margins, Enterobacteriaceae were enriched in CAC, and Bacteroidales in CRC. Pathobiont-specific qPCR confirmed a greater frequency of pks+ E. coli and enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis in CAC than IBD. High alpha diversity was associated with active inflammation, advanced cancer stage, and shorter overall survival (log-rank p = 0.008). Mucosal microbiomes distinguish CAC from longstanding IBD, implicating pathobionts as markers for disease progression.

This study combined RNA sequencing and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) on sorted PSCs from adjacent normal and PDAC tissues to investigate their transcriptional and epigenetic activation. PSCs heterogeneity and functions are characterized through bulk, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomes, as well as in situ sequencing. The clinical relevance of PSCs in immunotherapy is assessed using an in-house immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment cohort. Findings showed that stress and hypoxia signaling activated PSCs in PDAC. Three common PSCs (CPSCs) and four tumor-associated PSCs (TPSCs) are identified, each with distinct functions. CPSCs differentiated into CCL19(+) TPSCs in immune-enriched regions, MYH11(+) TPSCs in the stromal region, and PLXDC1(+) TPSCs, which exhibited cancer-associated myofibroblasts (myCAFs) phenotype linked to poor prognosis. Notably, PLXDC1(+) TPSCs, located near aggressive LRRC15(+) myCAFs and SPP1(+) macrophages, formed a desmoplastic and immunosuppressive niche around the tumor boundary, promoting CD8 T cell exhaustion. Single-cell transcriptomics of PDAC patients treated with ICB revealed that PLXDC1(+) TPSCs correlated with poor immunotherapy efficacy. Overall, this study provides key insights into PSCs in PDAC and potential therapeutic targets.",27/01/2025,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)"
,[Radiofrequency ablation of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor].,"Hlavsa, J,Procházka, V,Kala, Z,Man, M,Andrasina, T,Cíhalová, M,Válek, V,Crha, M,Svobodová, I,Urbanová, L","BACKGROUNDS: Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) include a broad range of neoplasms spanning from relatively benign to malignant. Radical resection has been advocated as the only curative method. Debulking (R2) resection can be indicated for locally unresectable PNETs. Debulking surgery improves the quality of life and prolongs overall survival. The disadvantages of this approach include bleeding, pancreatic fistula and tumor spread. No alternative method that would eliminate these complications has been published yet. Considering the encouraging results of the studies describing radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of locally advanced pancreatic cancer, a question arises, whether it might be possible to use RFA as a R2 resection alternative in PNETs. CASE: A 73-year-old gentleman had been admitted due to abdominal pain and hyperglycaemic syndrome. Contrast-enhanced CT showed a tumor of pancreatic head invading portal vein (PV) and superior mesenteric vein (VMS). A surgery was indicated on the basis of EUS-guided FNAB that verified a PNET of uncertain biological behaviour. The surgery confirmed a locally advanced tumor of pancreatic head invading the PV and SMV. Due to the polymorbidity, radical pancreatoduodenectomy with SMV resection was not indicated. Because of the presence of symptoms, RFA of the PNET using ValleyLab generator with cooltip cluster electrode, was performed. Postoperative course was uneventful. Final immunohistochemical examination verified a well-differentiated grade 1 PNET. The patient was regularly monitored during a three-year follow-up. The quality of life was evaluated using standardized EORT QLQ-30 questionnaire. Pain was assessed by a ten-point visual analogue scale (VAS). Ablated area was evaluated annually by contrast-enhanced CT. Postoperatively, abdominal pain ceased (pain decrease from 2 to 0 on VAS). Insulin dose was reduced from 46 IU (international units) to 20 IU of Humulin-R per day. CT verified tumor regression according to RECIST (response evaluation criteria in solid tumors). During the three-year follow-up, no local progression or tumor dissemination was observed. CONCLUSION: We present the first case report of a patient with locally advanced symptomatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor successfully treated by intraoperative radiofrequency ablation. More clinical studies are needed to evaluate the clinical relevance of this cytoreductive method in the PNET indication.",02/07/2011,Klinicka onkologie : casopis Ceske a Slovenske onkologicke spolecnosti

However, their fibrosis-independent and homeostatic functions remain poorly understood(1-5). Here we demonstrate that genetic depletion of HSCs changes WNT activity and zonation of hepatocytes, leading to marked alterations in liver regeneration, cytochrome P450 metabolism and injury. We identify R-spondin 3 (RSPO3), an HSC-enriched modulator of WNT signalling, as responsible for these hepatocyte-regulatory effects of HSCs. HSC-selective deletion of Rspo3 phenocopies the effects of HSC depletion on hepatocyte gene expression, zonation, liver size, regeneration and cytochrome P450-mediated detoxification, and exacerbates alcohol-associated and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. RSPO3 expression decreases with HSC activation and is inversely associated with outcomes in patients with alcohol-associated and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. These protective and hepatocyte-regulating functions of HSCs via RSPO3 resemble the R-spondin-expressing stromal niche in other organs and should be integrated into current therapeutic concepts.",04/03/2024,Nature

To combat the pandemic of AMR, it is necessary to focus on novel alternatives for drug development. Within the host, the interaction of the pathogen with the microbiome plays a pivotal role in determining the outcome of pathogenesis. Therefore, microbiome-pathogen interaction is one of the potential targets to be explored for novel antimicrobials. MAIN BODY: This review focuses on how the gut microbiome has evolved as a significant component of the resistome as a source of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Antibiotics alter the composition of the native microbiota of the host by favouring resistant bacteria that can manifest as opportunistic infections. Furthermore, gut dysbiosis has also been linked to low-dosage antibiotic ingestion or subtherapeutic antibiotic treatment (STAT) from food and the environment. DISCUSSION: Colonization by MDR bacteria is potentially acquired and maintained in the gut microbiota. Therefore, it is pivotal to understand microbial diversity and its role in adapting pathogens to AMR. Implementing several strategies to prevent or treat dysbiosis is necessary, including faecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics and prebiotics, phage therapy, drug delivery models, and antimicrobial stewardship regulation.",17/03/2025,Annals of medicine

However, the high costs of these medications have raised policy questions about their value and coverage decisions. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of 4 antiobesity medications with lifestyle modification vs lifestyle modification alone in the US. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A lifetime cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted in 2024 using the validated Diabetes, Obesity, Cardiovascular Disease Microsimulation model for US adults. Data were included from the 2017-2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of 4823 individuals (representing 126 million eligible US adults) aged 20 to 79 years who would meet clinical trial inclusion criteria for antiobesity medications. Individual-level simulations projected long-term cardiometabolic outcomes, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and health care expenditures. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses, subgroup analyses (across body mass index [BMI] categories [≥30 or ≥27 and at least 1 weight-related comorbidity], presence of comorbidities), and multiple scenario analyses (varying treatment discontinuation rates, value-based pricing benchmarks) were conducted. Future costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% annually. INTERVENTIONS: Lifestyle modification with naltrexone-bupropion, phentermine-topiramate, semaglutide, or tirzepatide vs lifestyle modification alone. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease cases averted, life-years and QALYs gained, costs incurred (2023 US dollars), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Among the 126 million eligible US adults, the mean age was 48 (SE, 0.5) years; 51% were female; and the initial mean BMI was 34.7 (SE, 0.2); and 85% had at least 1 weight-related comorbidity. Over a lifetime, tirzepatide would avert 45 609 obesity cases (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 45 092-46 126) per 100 000 individuals and semaglutide would avert 32 087 cases (95% UI, 31 292-32 882) per 100 000 individuals. Tirzepatide would reduce 20 854 incident cases of diabetes (95% UI, 19 432-22 276) per 100 000 individuals and semaglutide would reduce 19 211 cases (95% UI, 17 878-20 544) per 100 000 individuals. Tirzepatide would reduce 10 655 cardiovascular disease cases (95% UI, 10 124-11 186) per 100 000 individuals and semaglutide would reduce 8263 cases (95% UI, 7738-8788) per 100 000 individuals. Despite the largest incremental QALY gains of 0.35 for tirzepatide and 0.25 for semaglutide among all antiobesity medications, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $197 023/QALY and 467 676/QALY, respectively. To reach the $100 000/QALY threshold, their prices would require additional discounts by 30.5% for tirzepatide and 81.9% for semaglutide from their current net prices. Naltrexone-bupropion was cost saving due to its lower cost and had an 89.1% probability of being cost-effective at $100 000/QALY, whereas phentermine-topiramate had a 23.5% probability of being cost-effective at $100 000/QALY. Tirzepatide and semaglutide both had a 0% probability across all QALY threshold ranges examined ($100 000-$200 000/QALY). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This economic evaluation found that although tirzepatide and semaglutide offered substantial long-term health benefits, they were not cost-effective at current net prices. Efforts to reduce the net prices of new antiobesity medications are essential to ensure equitable access to highly effective antiobesity medications.",14/03/2025,JAMA health forum

Nevertheless, the correlation between CMI and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) among individuals exhibiting varying glucose metabolism statuses (GMS) continues to be unclear. METHODS: Overall, 24,006 individuals aged 20 and above were enrolled in the research, drawn from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database. Individuals in the study was classified into three distinct categories according to the level of fasting plasma glucose or glycated haemoglobin: normal glucose regulation, prediabetes, and DM. Multivariate logistic regression models and smoothed curve-fitting techniques were applied to investigate the correlation between CMI and ASCVD risk across varying GMS. Additionally, subgroup analyses stratified by relevant factors were performed to identify potential effect modifiers in this relationship. RESULTS: Overall, 2352 participants (9.8%) with ASCVD were included. An increasing trend in ASCVD risk was observed for each successive CMI tertile. After adjusting for all related covariates, a significantly positive association was observed between CMI and ASCVD (P = 0.0004). Participants with DM in the highest CMI tertile had a 114% higher ASCVD risk compared to those in the lowest tertile (OR = 2.14; 95% CI = 1.30-3.53). Smoothed curve-fitting consistently confirmed the correlation between CMI and ASCVD across diverse GMS. Subgroup analyses and interaction tests highlighted statistically significant differences within the drinking status subgroup (P-interaction = 0.0479) and GMS subgroups (P-interaction = 0.0397). CONCLUSION: This research suggests a positive association between ASCVD and CMI in adults in the United States, particularly among individuals with DM.",13/10/2024,Lipids in health and disease

No consensus exists on how serum uric acid (sUA) affects metabolism-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) in postmenopausal women.This prospective observational study examined this link using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017 to 2020 data. We divided women's sUA levels into four quartiles and used logistic regression, subgroup analyses, and restricted triple spline methods to compare the prevalence of MAFLD in postmenopausal and non-menopausal women. We also used histograms to analyze the effect of BMI-based indices. This population-based study involved 4477 women, including 1139 postmenopausal women aged 55-73 years. Multivariate logistic regression showed that, in the fully adjusted model, we found that participants in the highest quartile of sUA had a statistically significant 254% increased risk of MAFLD compared with participants in the lowest quartile (OR: 3.54; 95% CI 3.54 1.47-8.55; P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed no significant interaction between sUA levels and specific subgroups P( > 0.05 for all interactions). Additionally, RCS and threshold analysis showed a linear correlation (P = 0.186) and an ideal inflection point of 4.6 (P = 0.818) to the left. Right of the inflection point, the effect size was 1.524 (95% CI 1.291-1.814; P < 0.01). Histograms demonstrated that postmenopausal BMI increased sUA's influence on MAFLD and higher sUA levels and BMI may enhance the prevalence of MAFLA in US postmenopausal women. The results of this study suggest that monitoring sUA levels in the postmenopausal period is critical in determining the occurrence of and interventions for MAFLD.",05/11/2024,Scientific reports

However, the mechanisms underlying chemoresistance remain unclear. CBX3 promoted proliferation and metastasis in CRC. However, the role and mechanism of CBX3 in chemoresistance remain unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of CBX3 on multidrug resistance in CRC. Our studies showed that higher levels of CBX3 expression were associated with poor survival, especially in groups with progression following chemotherapy. CBX3 overexpression increased Irinotecan and Oxaliplatin resistance, whereas CBX3 knockdown suppressed multidrug resistance in CRC cells. Additionally, CBX3 inhibited ferroptosis associated with multidrug resistance, and the ferroptosis activators prevented CBX3 overexpression-mediated cell survival. RNA sequencing revealed that the NRF2-signaling pathway was involved in this process. CBX3-upregulated NRF2 protein expression by directly binding to the promoter of Cullin3 (CUL3) to suppress CUL3 transcription and CUL3-mediated NRF2 degradation. Moreover, Glutathione Peroxidase 2 (GPX2) was downstream of the CBX3-NRF2 pathway in CRC chemoresistance. ML385, an NRF2 inhibitor, suppressed GPX2 expression, and increased ferroptosis in PDX models.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between statin use and the risk of HCC and hepatic decompensation, with an emphasis on liver fibrosis progression, among adult patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used data from the Research Patient Data Registry from 2000 to 2023 on patients 40 years or older with CLD and a baseline Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score of 1.3 or higher. Participants were grouped into statin users and nonusers. Data analysis was conducted from August 5, 2024, to January 3, 2025. EXPOSURES: Statin use. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes included 10-year cumulative incidence of HCC and hepatic decompensation as well as transitions in liver fibrosis risk categories based on FIB-4 scores. Statin use was defined as exposure to a cumulative defined daily dose (cDDD) of 30 or more. Fibrosis progression was assessed through FIB-4 group transitions (low, intermediate, and high) over time. Outcomes were analyzed using adjusted subhazard ratio (aSHR) and trends in serial FIB-4 scores. RESULTS: The analysis included 16 501 participants (mean [SD] age, 59.7 [11.0] years; 6750 females [40.9%] and 9751 males [59.1%]) with CLD, including 3610 statin users and 12 891 nonusers. Statin users exhibited a significantly lower 10-year cumulative incidence of HCC (3.8% vs 8.0.%; risk difference, -4.2%; 95% CI, -5.3 to -3.1%) and hepatic decompensation (10.6% vs 19.5%; risk difference, -9.0%; 95% CI, -10.6 to -7.3) compared with nonusers. The aSHR was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.59 to 0.76) for HCC and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.67 to 0.91) for hepatic decompensation. Exposure to lipophilic statins and duration of statin use (≥600 cDDDs) were associated with further reductions in HCC and hepatic decompensation risks. Among 7038 patients with serial FIB-4 data, patients with intermediate baseline FIB-4 scores, 14.7% (95% CI, 13.0% to 16.6%) of statin users transitioned to the high group compared with 20.0% (95% CI, 18.6% to 21.5%) of nonusers. For patients with high baseline FIB-4 scores, 31.8% (95% CI, 28.0% to 35.9%) of statin users transitioned to the intermediate group and 7.0% (95% CI, 5.2% to 9.6%) transitioned to the low-risk group, compared to 18.8% (95% CI, 17.2% to 20.6%) and 4.3% (95% CI, 3.5% to 5.2%) of nonusers, respectively (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that statin use was associated with a reduced risk of HCC and hepatic decompensation in patients with CLD, as well as improved FIB-4 group transitions over time.

This study aims to identify the shared proteomic signatures of T2D and CHD, as well as whether the shared proteins predict incident CHD in T2D patients, and to develop predictive models. Utilizing data from 53,014 UK Biobank participants and 2923 plasma proteins, we identified 488 proteins associated with T2D, of which 125 proteins were also associated with CHD. Among the shared proteins, we determine nine proteins showing causal associations with CHD, including PCSK9, NRP1, and CD27. Mediation analyses suggest that the nine proteins mediate the association between T2D and CHD. By integrating these proteins into our predictive model, we achieved a desirable prediction (AUC = 0.819) for future CHD onset in T2D patients. Additionally, druggability evaluation show 32 potential therapeutic agents, including established antihypertensives and nine novel compounds, suggesting avenues for dual-targeted treatment strategies. Collectively, our findings unveil the proteomic signatures associated with both T2D and CHD, providing implications for screening and predicting future CHD onset in T2D patients.",19/01/2025,Cardiovascular diabetology

Recent studies emphasize the role of vascular factors, including the glymphatic system, in AD pathogenesis, particularly in Aβ clearance. The diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS; ALPS-Index) has emerged as a novel, non-invasive method to evaluate the glymphatic system in vivo, showing glymphatic insufficiency in AD. This study aimed to investigate alterations in the function of the glymphatic system in individuals with AD versus healthy controls (HC), and to explore its association with Aβ, cerebrovascular disease (CVD), white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and cognitive function. METHODS: DTI MRI data from three independent study cohorts (ActiGliA: AD n = 16, Controls n = 18; DELCODE: AD n = 54, Controls n = 67; ADNI: AD n = 43, Controls n = 49) were used to evaluate the perivascular space (PVS) integrity; a potential biomarker for glymphatic activity. The DTI-Along the Perivascular Space technique was used to measure water diffusion along PVS providing an index to assess the efficiency of the glymphatic system's waste clearance function. WMH load was quantified in FLAIR MRI using the lesion segmentation tool. We quantified WMHs volume within our defined region of interest (ROI) and excluded participants with any WMHs to avoid confounding the ALPS-Index. Associations with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD hallmark biomarkers, cognitive performance (MMSE) and clinical severity (CDR) were assessed. RESULTS: AD patients had a significantly lower ALPS-Index vs. healthy controls (ActiGliA: AD: mean = 1.22, SD = 0.12; Controls: mean = 1.36, SD = 0.14, p = 0.004; DELCODE: AD: mean = 1.26, SD = 0.18; Controls: mean = 1.34, SD = 0.2, p = 0.035; ADNI: AD: mean = 1.08, SD = 0.24; Controls: mean = 1.19, SD = 0.13, p = 0.008). The ALPS-Index was associated with CSF Aβ concentration, WMH number and MMSE and CDR. WMH, found in the ROIs correlated negatively with the ALPS-Index. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential of the DTI-ALPS-Index as a biomarker for glymphatic dysfunction in AD. It underscores the importance of considering vascular factors and the glymphatic system in the pathogenesis and diagnosis of AD as WMHs in the ROI could cause disturbances and inaccurate indices.",20/11/2024,Alzheimer's research & therapy

The defining characteristic of B. thuringiensis that sets it apart from B. cereus and B. anthracis is the production of crystal (Cry) proteins, which are pore-forming toxins or pore-forming proteins (PFPs). Although it is known that PFPs are important virulence factors since their elimination results in reduced virulence of many pathogenic bacteria, the functions by which PFPs promote virulence are incompletely understood. Here we study the effect of Cry proteins in B. thuringiensis pathogenesis of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that whereas B. thuringiensis on its own is not able to infect C. elegans, the addition of the PFP Cry protein, Cry5B, results in a robust lethal infection that consumes the nematode host in 1-2 days, leading to a ""Bob"" or bag-of-bacteria phenotype. Unlike other infections of C. elegans characterized to date, the infection by B. thuringiensis shows dose-dependency based on bacterial inoculum size and based on PFP concentration. Although the infection process takes 1-2 days, the PFP-instigated infection process is irreversibly established within 15 minutes of initial exposure. Remarkably, treatment of C. elegans with Cry5B PFP is able to instigate many other Bacillus species, including B. anthracis and even ""non-pathogenic"" Bacillus subtilis, to become lethal and infectious agents to C. elegans. Co-culturing of Cry5B-expressing B. thuringiensis with B. anthracis can result in lethal infection of C. elegans by B. anthracis. Our data demonstrate that one potential property of PFPs is to sensitize the host to bacterial infection and further that C. elegans and probably other roundworms can be common hosts for B. cereus-group bacteria, findings with important ecological and research implications.",04/11/2011,PloS one

However, the causal relationship between these two conditions remains poorly understood. This study aimed to elucidate the causal relationship between thyroid function and MS using a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) approach and to investigate the potential mediating role of immune cells. We conducted a two-sample MR analysis using summary statistics from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We included results from sensitivity tests such as MR-Egger, weighted median, and leave-one-out analyses to support the robustness and reliability of the findings. The inverse variance-weighted (IVW) method was the primary approach, with sensitivity analyses conducted using seven additional MR methods. Furthermore, multivariable MR and mediation analysis were conducted to uncover potential mediating immune cells underlying the observed associations. The MR analysis showed that Hypothyroidism and elevated Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels(normal) reduced the risk of MS (P = 0.012, OR (95%CI) :0.914(0.851, 0.98); P = 0.020, OR (95%CI) :0.88(0.789, 0.98)). Free thyroxine (FT4) increased the risk of MS (P = 0.020, OR (95%CI) :1.268(1.051, 1.53)). Mediation analysis showed evidence of indirect effect of FT4 on MS through ""HLA DR on CD33br HLA DR + CD14"" and ""IgD- CD27- %B cell"" with a mediated proportion of 39.16% (positive effect), 78.53% (reverse effect) of the total effect. This study provided genetic evidence that FT4 may increase the risk of developing MS.

This study examines the relationship between RAR and depressive disorder in U.S. adults, utilizing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). METHODS: We applied logistic regression to evaluate the link between RAR and depressive risk, with its corresponding odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) calculated. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) was adopted to assess the potential linear association, while the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the ability of RAR to predict the depressive risk, with the result presented as an area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: After adjusting for relevant covariates, a positive association between RAR and clinically relevant depression persisted (OR = 1.33, 95 % CI: 1.18-1.51, P < 0.001). Participants in the highest RAR quartile exhibited a greater risk of clinically relevant depression than those in the lowest quartile (OR = 1.36, 95 % CI: 1.10-1.67, P = 0.005). A linear relationship between RAR and clinically relevant depression was identified (P for non-linear = 0.473), with RAR showing a strong predictive ability for depressive risk (AUC = 0.7467). Stratified analysis showed significant interactions among smoking (P = 0.045), marital status (P < 0.001), and RAR's effect on depression outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated RAR is independently linked to clinically relevant depression, indicating its potential as a novel biomarker for mental health risk assessment.

METHODS: The age-standardized incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were calculated using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study from 1990 to 2021. These indicators were stratified by sex, age, and socio-demographic index (SDI). The correlation between these indicators and SDI was assessed. Temporal trends were quantified using the annual average percentage change (AAPC), and future trends from 2022 to 2040 were predicted using the Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) model. RESULTS: The global age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of KC among older adults increased from 21.73 per 100,000 people in 1990 to 26.74 per 100,000 people in 2021, with an AAPC of 0.67%. Age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDR) remained stable, while significant increases were observed in age-standardized prevalence (AAPC = 1.24%, 95%CI: 1.14-1.34%) and mortality rate (AAPC = 0.13%, 95%CI: 0.05-0.22%). From 1990 to 2021, males consistently exhibited a higher disease burden than females, additionally, the ASIR of KC increased significantly in all age subgroups. Regions with higher SDI levels also showed a greater disease burden, while Oceania had the lowest burden of KC in 2021. The ASIR increased in almost all countries and territories. Czechia showed the highest ASIR (92.25 per 100,000 people) and ASDR (819.88 per 100,000 people). Smoking and high body mass index (BMI) remained significant risk factors for DALYs and mortality in the older population, and their effects were greatest in high SDI region. Furthermore, the burden of KC is expected to continue to decline through 2040. CONCLUSIONS: The global burden of KC among older adults increased from 1990 to 2021, with notable regional and national variations. However, it is projected to continue to decline through 2040. The management of smoking and high BMI remain major challenges for people with KC, necessitating targeted clinical guidelines, particularly focusing on males and the older adults.",17/12/2024,BMC cancer

We aimed to investigate the burden, trend and population disparity in 33 early-onset cancers from 2012 to 2021. METHODS: Annual incidence, death, and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) numbers and rates for early-onset (15-49 years) cancer groups were calculated from Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) 2021 dataset, covering 2012-2021 across global, five SDI groupings, and 204 countries and territories. Estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) in the incidence, mortality and DALY rates was calculated to quantify temporal trends, while spearman correlation analysis was used to examine the correlation between rates, EAPC and SDI. RESULTS: In 2021, there were 2.65 million new early-onset cancer cases excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), resulting in 0.99 million deaths and 50.7 million DALYs. Breast, tracheal, bronchus and lung (TBL), cervical, colon and stomach cancers were the leading causes of DALYs. The DALY rate for early-onset cancer excluding NMSC changed from 65.7 million in 2012 to 67.0 million in 2021, with an estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) of -0.49%. While the DALY rate plateaued for females, it decreased by -0.95% for males. Ten of 33 cancer groups exhibited an EAPC > 0. The high SDI quintile had 1,100 DALYs per 100,000 caused by early-onset cancers excluding NMSC, with the highest declining trend in DALY and mortality rates, while the high-middle SDI quintile had the highest early-onset mortality rates. Rising trends in cancer incidence and mortality were especially notable among females in the middle, low-middle, and low SDI quintiles. CONCLUSION: The global burden of early-onset cancer differs significantly by SDI quintile and gender. The increasing burden across multiple cancer groups poses a significant public health challenge. The rising burden of multiple cancer types is alarming, highlighting the need for increased policy support and targeted medical assistance to address the disparities in their impact.",09/01/2025,Experimental hematology & oncology
10.1016/j.actbio.2012.11.029,Sintering of calcium phosphate bioceramics.,"Champion, E","Calcium phosphate ceramics have become of prime importance for biological applications in the field of bone tissue engineering. This paper reviews the sintering behaviour of these bioceramics. Conventional pressureless sintering of hydroxyapatite, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, a reference compound, has been extensively studied. Its physico-chemistry is detailed. It can be seen as a competition between two thermally activated phenomena that proceed by solid-state diffusion of matter: densification and grain growth. Usually, the objective is to promote the first and prevent the second. Literature data are analysed from sintering maps (i.e. grain growth vs. densification). Sintering trajectories of hydroxyapatite produced by conventional pressureless sintering and non-conventional techniques, including two-step sintering, liquid phase sintering, hot pressing, hot isostatic pressing, ultrahigh pressure, microwave and spark plasma sintering, are presented. Whatever the sintering technique may be, grain growth occurs mainly during the last step of sintering, when the relative bulk density reaches 95% of the maximum value. Though often considered very advantageous, most assisted sintering techniques do not appear very superior to conventional pressureless sintering. Sintering of tricalcium phosphate or biphasic calcium phosphates is also discussed. The chemical composition of calcium phosphate influences the behaviour. Similarly, ionic substitutions in hydroxyapatite or in tricalcium phosphate create lattice defects that modify the sintering rate. Depending on their nature, they can either accelerate or slow down the sintering rate. The thermal stability of compounds at the sintering temperature must also be taken into account. Controlled atmospheres may be required to prevent thermal decomposition, and flash sintering techniques, which allow consolidation at low temperature, can be helpful.",27/07/2012,Acta biomaterialia

TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis complex 2), a gene mutated in an autosomal dominant disease tuberous sclerosis, was shown to be the Rheb-GAP (GTPase activating protein).(5,6) However, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rheb had been missing. Human TCTP (translationally controlled tumor protein) has been implicated in cancer, but its function in vivo has not been clearly elucidated. Recently we reported a molecular genetic characterization of TCTP function in Drosophila.(7) Drosophila TCTP (dTCTP) displays GEF activity to Rheb and is essential for Rheb activation in organ growth.

Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability worldwide. This study investigated the relationship between serum UHR and mortality in adults with stroke. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study recruited 1,382 participants with stroke from the 2005-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Mortality outcome data were determined by the National Death Index (NDI). Multivariate hazard ratio (HR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were assessed using Cox proportional risk modeling and threshold effects analysis. Stratified analyses identified high-risk mortality groups. Among the participants, 508 all-cause mortality occurred, including 135 cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. After multivariate adjustment, UHR was significantly and linearly associated with all-cause mortality (HR 1.05, 95 % CI 1.01-1.08). An inverted U-shaped relationship was observed between UHR and CVD mortality, plateauing at 14.42 %. Below this threshold, a 1-unit increase in UHR was linked to a 27 % higher risk of CVD mortality (HR 1.27, 95 % CI 1.07-1.51). However, above the threshold, a 1-unit increase in UHR corresponded to a 11 % reduction in CVD mortality (HR 0.89, 95 % CI 0.79-1.00).

Of 80 patients presenting to our hospital with postvaccination syndrome, 28 met the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS. We conducted a retrospective study on these 28 patients. METHODS: We measured serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in 28 patients who developed ME/CFS after COVID-19 vaccination between August 2022 and February 2024. Vitamin D replacement therapy included dietary counseling, sun exposure recommendations, and oral vitamin D supplementation. We evaluated changes in blood vitamin D levels and symptom improvement. RESULTS: At initial visit, 27 of 28 patients diagnosed with ME/CFS had insufficient or deficient serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (16 ± 4 ng/mL, mean ± SD). Following vitamin D replacement therapy, we observed an increase in blood vitamin D levels (28 ± 5 ng/mL) associated with a decrease in ME/CFS diagnostic symptoms (from 10.3 ± 2.1 to 3.3 ± 2.0). Notably, 23 of 28 patients (82%) no longer met ME/CFS diagnostic criteria after the therapy. Among the symptoms, sleep problems showed the most improvement (71%), followed by autonomic symptoms (68%). CONCLUSIONS: For patients developing ME/CFS after COVID-19 vaccination with insufficient or deficient vitamin D levels, appropriate vitamin D replacement therapy under medical guidance may lead to symptomatic relief. We are preparing a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D replacement therapy in individuals with ME/CFS who have developed vitamin D deficiency following COVID-19 infection or vaccination.",29/09/2024,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)"
,Role of fluoxetine in anorexia nervosa.,"Kim, Sara S","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of fluoxetine in the treatment of anorexia nervosa. DATA SOURCES: Literature obtained through searching MEDLINE (1966-January 2003). DATA SYNTHESIS: Studies conducted on the efficacy of fluoxetine in treating anorexia nervosa have conflicting results. Study design and methodology should be carefully evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Fluoxetine played a role in the reduction of symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression in anorexic patients. While psychotherapy, nutritional therapy, and behavioral therapy should be the mainstays of treatment, fluoxetine should be considered as an option to prevent relapse or to treat associated symptoms of anorexia nervosa following adequate weight restoration as a part of maintenance therapy and not as a primary or acute therapy. Although fluoxetine appears to be promising for the treatment of patients with anorexia nervosa, further studies need to be performed with a larger sample size and/or better design.",30/05/2003,The Annals of pharmacotherapy

This finding is intriguing since CHO cells do not generate α2-6 sialylation, which constitutes the majority of human pdVWF sialylation. We hypothesized that glycan differences might regulate the longer half-life of CHO-rVWF. In lectin plate binding assays and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis, we confirmed that CHO-rVWF lacked α2-6 linked sialylation. Conversely, however, α2-3 linked sialylation was significantly increased on CHO-rVWF, which also had reduced exposed β-Gal compared to pdVWF. Consistent with human data, CHO-rVWF clearance was significantly (p<0.001) reduced in VWF-/- mice compared to pdVWF. However, clearance of asialo-pdVWF and asialo-CHO-rVWF were identical. In keeping with the in vivo half-life prolongation, CHO-rVWF binding to murine macrophages (p=0.012) and HepG2 cells (p=0.001) was significantly decreased compared to pdVWF. Furthermore, CHO-rVWF binding to purified MGL and ASGPR receptors was also significantly reduced. In contrast to pdVWF, in vivo studies in MGL1-/- mice and Asgr1-/- mice demonstrated that neither MGL nor ASGPR play significant roles in regulating CHO-rVWF clearance. Together, our findings demonstrate that enhanced α2-3 linked sialylation on CHO-rVWF is responsible for its extended in vivo half-life.",26/02/2025,Blood

However, only a subset of neoantigens effectively elicits anti-tumor immune responses, and the specific neoantigens recognized by individual T cell receptors (TCRs) remain incompletely characterized. Therefore, substantial research has focused on screening immunogenic neoantigens, mainly through their major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presentation and TCR recognition specificity. Given the resource-intensiveness and inefficiency of experimental validation, predictive models based on artificial intelligence (AI) have gradually become mainstream methods to discover immunogenic neoantigens. Here, we provided a comprehensive summary of current AI methodologies for predicting neoantigens, with a particular focus on their capability to model peptide-MHC (pMHC) and pMHC-TCR binding. Furthermore, a thorough benchmarking analysis was conducted to assess the performance of antigen presentation predictors for scoring the immunogenicity of neoantigens. AI models have potential applications in the treatment of clinical diseases, although several limitations must first be overcome to realize their full potential. Anticipated advancements in data accessibility, algorithmic refinement, platform enhancement, and comprehensive validation of immune processes are poised to enhance the precision and utility of neoantigen prediction methodologies.",12/03/2025,Cancer research

One of the underlying mechanisms may be intracerebral inflammation due to decreases in acetylcholine levels. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of donepezil hydrochloride, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, on post-COVID-19 fatigue and psychological symptoms. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multicenter, double-blind randomized clinical trial was performed in Japan. Between December 14, 2022, and March 31, 2024, adult patients within 52 weeks of the onset of COVID-19 and with a global binary fatigue score of 4 or greater on the Chalder Fatigue Scale were randomized into a donepezil or a placebo group. EXPOSURE: The intervention was conducted during a 3-week period, with donepezil hydrochloride being administered at a dosage of 3 mg/d for the first week and then 5 mg/d for 2 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a change in the Chalder Fatigue Scale score and the absolute score 3 weeks after the initiation of treatment. Other outcomes at 3 and 8 weeks, such as psychological symptoms and quality of life, were evaluated as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 120 eligible patients were enrolled and 10 withdrew or were lost to follow-up; therefore, 110 patients (55 in each group) were included in the efficacy analysis (64 [58%] female; mean [SD] age, 43 [12] years). No significant differences were observed in baseline characteristics between the 2 groups. The baseline-adjusted estimating treatment effect of donepezil, measured as the mean difference on Chalder Fatigue Scale scores at 3 weeks, was 0.34 (95% CI, -2.23 to 2.91), showing no significant effect of the intervention (P = .79). Scores for the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Impact of Event Scale-Revised, EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level Version, Patient Health Questionnaire, and Daily Health Status at 3 and 8 weeks were similar. No serious adverse events occurred in either group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of donepezil to treat post-COVID-19 condition, the efficacy for fatigue and psychological symptoms was not confirmed in a general population. The development of effective therapeutics for post-COVID-19 symptoms is needed, and more clinical trials should be conducted in the future.

Here, we identified REGγ as a mutant KRAS-associated factor that enhanced REGγ transcription through the KRAS intermediate NRF2, suggesting that the REGγ-proteasome is a potential target for pan-KRAS inhibitor development. We elucidated a mechanism involving the KRAS/NRF2/REGγ regulatory axis, which links activated KRAS to the ATP- and ubiquitin-independent proteasome. We subsequently developed RLY01, a REGγ-proteasome inhibitor that effectively suppressed tumor growth in KRAS-mutant cancer models and lung cancer organoids. Notably, the combination of RLY01 and the KRASG12C inhibitor AMG510 exhibited enhanced antitumor efficacy in KRASG12C cancer cells. Collectively, our data support the hypothesis that KRAS mutations enhance the capacity of the REGγ-proteasome by increasing REGγ expression, highlighting the potential of ubiquitin-independent proteasome inhibition as a therapeutic approach for pan-KRAS-mutant cancers.",25/07/2024,The Journal of clinical investigation

Several congenital or acquired disorders may cause either selective or global malabsorption in both children and adults, such as cystic fibrosis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), coeliac disease (CD) and other enteropathies, lactase deficiency, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), autoimmune atrophic gastritis, Crohn's disease, and gastric or small bowel resections. Early recognition of malabsorption is key for tailoring a proper diagnostic work-up for identifying the cause of malabsorption. Patient's medical and pharmacological history are essential for identifying risk factors. Several examinations like endoscopy with small intestinal biopsies, non-invasive functional tests, and radiologic imaging are useful in diagnosing malabsorption. Due to its high prevalence, CD should always be looked for in case of malabsorption with no other obvious explanations and in high-risk individuals. Nutritional support is key in management of patients with malabsorption; different options are available, including oral supplements, enteral or parenteral nutrition. In patients with short bowel syndrome, teduglutide proved effective in reducing the need for parenteral nutrition, thus improving the quality of life of these patients. Primary care physicians have a central role in early detection of malabsorption and should be involved into multidisciplinary teams for improving the overall management of these patients. In this European consensus, involving 10 scientific societies and several experts, we have dissected all the issues around malabsorption, including the definitions and diagnostic testing (Part 1), high-risk categories and special populations, nutritional assessment and management, and primary care perspective (Part 2).",14/02/2025,United European gastroenterology journal

While physical activity has been linked to cognitive enhancement, the specific effects of intermittent short bouts of exercise, termed 'exercise snacks' (ES), on cognitive function (CF) in older adults are not well understood. METHODS: We analyzed data from 2549 adults aged ≥60 years from the 2011-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cycles. CF was assessed using standardized tests, and physical activity data were obtained from accelerometer measurements. ES was defined as 2-5 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Regression analyses, smoothed curve fitting, and threshold effect analyses were conducted, adjusting for relevant covariates. RESULTS: Significant positive associations were found between CF and daily average Monitor-Independent Movement Summary specific to ES (MIMS-ES: β = 0.0001, 95 % CI: 0.0001-0.0001) and total time spent on ES (Time-ES: β = 0.0021, 95 % CI: 0.0014-0.0029). Each additional unit of MIMS-ES and each minute of ES daily increased CF scores by 0.0001 and 0.0021 points, respectively, suggesting benefits for cognitive health in aging populations. An inverted U-shaped relationship was observed, with inflection points at 2522.82 units/day for MIMS-ES and 91.57 min/day for Time-ES, indicating diminishing cognitive benefits beyond these thresholds. CONCLUSION: ES was associated with higher CF. This practical form of physical activity offers an effective strategy for cognitive health and mitigating age-related decline, presenting a more accessible alternative to traditional continuous exercise.",17/10/2024,General hospital psychiatry

Viral mimicry augments antitumor immune responses and sensitizes solid tumors to immunotherapy. Here, we found that targeting what we believe to be a novel, master epigenetic regulator, Zinc Finger Protein 638 (ZNF638), induces viral mimicry in glioblastoma (GBM) preclinical models and potentiates immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). ZNF638 recruits the HUSH complex, which precipitates repressive H3K9me3 marks on endogenous REs. In GBM, ZNF638 is associated with marked locoregional immunosuppressive transcriptional signatures, reduced endogenous RE expression, and poor immune cell infiltration. Targeting ZNF638 decreased H3K9 trimethylation, increased REs, and activated intracellular dsRNA signaling cascades. Furthermore, ZNF638 knockdown upregulated antiviral immune programs and significantly increased PD-L1 immune checkpoint expression in diverse GBM models. Importantly, targeting ZNF638 sensitized mice to ICI in syngeneic murine orthotopic models through innate IFN signaling. This response was recapitulated in recurrent GBM (rGBM) samples with radiographic responses to checkpoint inhibition with widely increased expression of dsRNA, PD-L1, and perivascular CD8 cell infiltration, suggesting that dsRNA signaling may mediate response to immunotherapy. Finally, low ZNF638 expression was a biomarker of clinical response to ICI and improved survival in patients with rGBM and patients with melanoma. Our findings suggest that ZNF638 could serve as a target to potentiate immunotherapy in gliomas.",10/06/2024,The Journal of clinical investigation

We demonstrate that ecDNAs drive varying levels of MYC dosage, depending on their regulatory landscape, enabling cancer cells to rapidly and reversibly adapt to microenvironmental changes. In the absence of selective pressure, a high ecDNA copy number imposes a substantial fitness cost on PDAC cells. We also show that MYC dosage affects cell morphology and dependence of cancer cells on stromal niche factors.

10.1037/tra0000413,Self-reported mindfulness and soldier health following a combat deployment.,"Nassif, Thomas H,Start, Amanda R,Toblin, Robin L,Adler, Amy B","OBJECTIVE: Combat exposure has been linked to health-related challenges associated with postcombat adjustment, including mental health symptoms, behavior-related problems, physical pain, and functional impairment. Mindfulness, or acceptance of the present moment without reactivity or judgment, may be associated with better mental health following a combat deployment. This study examined whether self-reported mindfulness predicted soldier health outcomes over the course of the postdeployment period. METHOD: U.S. soldiers (n = 627) were surveyed 4 months after a deployment to Afghanistan (T1) and again 3 months later (T2). Mindfulness was assessed using the nonreactivity to inner experience subscale of the Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire. Hierarchical linear regressions examined how mindfulness (T1) moderated the impact of combat exposure (T1) on outcomes at T2. RESULTS: Controlling for rank, the interaction between combat exposure and mindfulness significantly predicted posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depression symptoms, risk-taking behaviors, pain symptoms, and functional impairment. The interaction term explained 1% to 2% of the variance in these health outcomes. Simple slopes analyses revealed that combat exposure was associated with more PTSD symptoms, depression symptoms, risk-taking behaviors, pain symptoms, and functional impairment when soldiers reported low levels of mindfulness. There was no effect for alcohol misuse, sleep difficulties, or aggressive behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Nonreactivity to inner experience may mitigate the detrimental effects of high-levels of combat exposure on both mental and physical health outcomes. These findings indicate that mindfulness strategies such as nonreactivity may be particularly useful for employees facing potentially traumatic stressors in a high-risk occupational context.

It functions autonomously while maintaining close communication with the central nervous system (CNS) via the gut-brain axis (GBA). ENS dysfunction plays a crucial role in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and autism spectrum disorder. Disruptions such as altered neurotransmission, gut microbiota imbalance, and neuroinflammation contribute to disease pathogenesis. The GBA enables bidirectional communication through the vagus nerve, gut hormones, immune signaling, and microbial metabolites, linking gut health to neurological function. ENS dysregulation is implicated in conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), influencing systemic and CNS pathology through neuroinflammation and impaired barrier integrity. This review highlights emerging therapeutic strategies targeting ENS dysfunction, including prebiotics, probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and vagus nerve stimulation, which offer novel ways to modulate gut-brain interactions. Unlike previous perspectives that view the ENS as a passive disease marker, this review repositions it as an active driver of neurological disorders. By integrating advances in ENS biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and GBA modulation, this article presents a paradigm shift-emphasizing ENS dysfunction as a fundamental mechanism in neurodegeneration and neurodevelopmental disorders. This perspective paves the way for innovative diagnostics, personalized gut-targeted therapies, and a deeper understanding of the ENS's role in brain health and disease.",30/01/2025,Neuroscience

Numerous studies have demonstrated that the activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor 4 (ErbB4) is crucial in neuronal injury and regeneration processes. This study investigated the role of targeted activation of ErbB4 receptor through a small molecule agonist, 4-bromo-1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (C11H7BrO3, E4A), in mitigating PS-MPs-induced neuronal injury. The findings revealed that targeted activation of ErbB4 receptor significantly ameliorated cognitive behavioral deficits in mice exposed to PS-MPs. Furthermore, E4A treatment upregulated the expression of dedicator of cytokinesis 3 (DOCK3) and Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) and mitigated mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunction within the hippocampus of PS-MPs-exposed mice. E4A also diminished the activation of the TLR4-NF-κB-NLRP3 signaling pathway, consequently reducing neuroinflammation. In vitro experiments demonstrated that E4A partially alleviated PS-MPs-induced hippocampal neuronal injury and its effects on microglial inflammation. In conclusion, the findings of this study indicate that targeted activation of ErbB4 receptor may mitigate neuronal damage and subsequent neuroinflammation, thereby alleviating hippocampal neuronal injury induced by PS-MPs exposure and ameliorating cognitive dysfunction.

To identify events in DCIS that lead to invasive cancer, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) on DCIS lesions and matched normal breast tissue. Inferred copy number variation (CNV) was used to identify neoplastic epithelial cells from clinical specimens, which contained a mixture of DCIS and normal ducts. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated intratumoral clonal heterogeneity that was associated with significant gene expression differences. Classification of epithelial cells into mammary cell states revealed that subclones contained a mixture of cell states, suggesting an ongoing pattern of differentiation after neoplastic transformation. Cell state proportions were significantly different based on estrogen receptor (ER) expression with ER-negative DCIS more closely resembling the distribution in the normal breast, particularly with respect to cells with basal characteristics. Specific alterations in cell state proportions were associated with progression to invasive cancer in a cohort of DCIS with longitudinal outcome. Ongoing transcription of key basement membrane (BM) genes occurred in specific subsets of epithelial cell states, including basal/myoepithelial, which are diminished in DCIS. In the transition to invasive breast cancer, the BM protein laminin, but not COL4, was altered in DCIS adjacent to invasion. Loss of COL4, but not laminin, in an in vitro DCIS model led to an invasive phenotype. These findings suggest that the process of invasion is a loss-of-function event due to an imbalance in critical cell populations essential for BM integrity rather than a gain of an invasive phenotype by neoplastic cells.",12/03/2025,Cancer research

10.7150/thno.104858,Targeting platinum-resistant ovarian cancer by disrupting histone and RAD51 lactylation.,"Sun, Chenggong,Li, Xiao,Teng, Qiuli,Liu, Xihan,Song, Li,Schiöth, Helgi B,Wu, Huan,Ma, Xinyue,Zhang, Zhaoyang,Qi, Changjian,Zhang, Haocheng,Song, Kun,Zhang, Qing,Kong, Beihua","Rationale: Ovarian cancer is a highly lethal gynecological malignancy with common platinum resistance. Lactylation is involved in multiple biological processes. Thus, we explored the role of histone and non-histone lactylation in platinum resistance, providing a potential therapeutic target to overcome platinum resistance in ovarian cancer. Methods: We utilized gene set enrichment analysis to investigate lactylation-related pathway alterations between platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive patients from the TCGA cohort. Differential expression of H3K9la was demonstrated using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Progression-free and overall survival were determined using a log-rank test. Drug response to cisplatin was evaluated by CCK8, apoptosis flow cytometry, and clonogenic assays in vitro. ChIP-seq and ChIP-qPCR assays were performed to identify downstream targets of H3K9la, which was further confirmed by qRT-PCR. LC-MS/MS was conducted to identify specific lactylation sites for RAD51. Co-IP was used to reveal the interaction between GCN5 and H3K9la or RAD51la. Cell line-derived and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of ovarian cancer were constructed for the in vivo experiments. Results: Our study showed elevated histone lactylation, especially of H3K9la, in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Moreover, high H3K9la indicated platinum resistance and poor prognosis of ovarian cancer. Impairing H3K9la enhanced response to cisplatin. Mechanistically, H3K9la directly activated RAD51 and BRCA2 expression to facilitate homologous recombination (HR) repair. Furthermore, RAD51K73la enhanced HR repair and subsequently conferred cisplatin resistance. H3K9la and RAD51K73la shared the same upstream regulator, GCN5. Notably, a GCN5 inhibitor remarkably improved the tumor-killing ability of cisplatin in PDX models of ovarian cancer. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated the essential role of histone and RAD51 lactylation in HR repair and platinum resistance. It also identified a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome platinum resistance and improve prognosis in ovarian cancer.",08/10/2024,Theranostics

This study investigated the impact of gut microbiota on intrahepatic metastasis of HCC and evaluated the therapeutic potential of healthy fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Dysregulation of the gut microbiota, characterized by a significant reduction in the abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as Anaerotruncus colihominis and Dysosmobacter welbionis, was observed in patients with intrahepatic metastatic HCC. A human flora-associated (HFA) intrahepatic metastatic HCC mouse model was successfully established through consecutive 4 weeks of human-mouse FMT. Dysregulation of gut microbiota promoted intrahepatic metastasis in the mouse model, primarily by enhancing neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses and lead to excessive formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Consequently, it promoted tumor vascular growth and tissue necrosis, resulting in intrahepatic metastasis of HCC. Notably, FMT from healthy donors mitigated these pathological processes. This study elucidated the role and mechanism of dysregulated gut microbiota in promoting intrahepatic metastasis of HCC. Healthy FMT emerges as a promising novel therapeutic strategy for preventing and treating intrahepatic metastasis of HCC.",18/03/2025,Gut microbes

Understanding the influenza mortality burden in ICU settings can inform treatment planning and resource allocation. Nonetheless, surveillance data on mortality in ICU-admitted patients are scarce and estimates vary greatly. This systematic literature review (SLR) and meta-analysis investigated all-cause mortality risk among ICU-admitted patients with influenza in Europe. METHODS: We included observational studies conducted in Europe that reported mortality among patients ≥ 6 months of age with influenza admitted to the ICU. Studies published between January-2009 and December-2019 were included. Quality was assessed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Pooled all-cause mortality risk was calculated as a proportion using a random-effects model with an inverse variance method. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted, including only studies identified as having low risk of bias. RESULTS: Thirty-seven studies, reporting on 13,616 patients, were included. All-cause mortality ranged from 0% to 67%. The overall pooled mortality risk estimate was 0.24 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.27). Study heterogeneity was high (Cochran's Q test p < 0.01, I(2) = 93%). The sensitivity analysis using only studies identified as having low risk of bias produced a pooled mortality risk of 0.25 (95%CI: 0.21, 0.29). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that approximately a quarter of patients with influenza admitted to the ICU die, reinforcing the need for effective vaccination programs and treatment optimization.",27/12/2024,Influenza and other respiratory viruses

Recently, mQTL and iQTL maps have proven useful in understanding relationships between SNPs and GWAS that are not captured by eQTL. In this context, we propose that part of the genetic predisposition to complex neuropsychiatric disorders acts through placental DNA methylation. We construct a public placental cis-mQTL database including 214,830 CpG sites calculated in 368 fetal placenta DNA samples from the INMA project, and run cell type-, gestational age- and sex-imQTL models. We combine these data with summary statistics of GWAS on ten neuropsychiatric disorders using summary-based Mendelian randomization and colocalization. We also evaluate the influence of identified DNA methylation sites on placental gene expression in the RICHS cohort. We find that placental cis-mQTLs are enriched in placenta-specific active chromatin regions, and establish that part of the genetic burden for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder confers risk through placental DNA methylation. The potential causality of several of the observed associations is reinforced by secondary association signals identified in conditional analyses, the involvement of cell type-imQTLs, and the correlation of identified DNA methylation sites with the expression levels of relevant genes in the placenta.",14/03/2023,Nature communications

METHODS: This 16-week, prospective, randomized, open-label study enrolled patients aged 18-75 years with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels between ≥ 8% and ≤ 11%. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved HbA1c < 7% at week 16 without hypoglycemia or weight gain. The secondary endpoints included blood glucose, lipid profile, body weight, body mass index, inflammatory markers, bone Gla-protein, liver enzymes, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Among the full analysis set of 147 participants, no significant difference was observed in the primary endpoint between the test group and the control group. However, the test group had a higher percentage of patients who achieved HbA1c <7% at week 16 without hypoglycemia and experienced a weight loss of ≥3% (31.51% vs 13.51%, P=0.009). Patients in the test group whose BMI≥24 kg/m(2) also achieved a substantial achievement rate (36.73% vs 15.79%, P=0.014). The test group also exhibited a greater reduction in body weight and improvements in 2-hour postprandial glucose level, systolic blood pressure, and lipid profile. Notably, combination therapy did not increase the risk of hypoglycemia or weight gain. Patients in the test group were more satisfied than those in the control group with continuing to accept pioglitazone/metformin FDC combined with dapagliflozin. CONCLUSION: In the absence of contraindications, pioglitazone/metformin FDC supplemented with dapagliflozin may serve as a safe and effective alternative to basal insulin combined with metformin for rectifying inadequate glucose control, as the former enables metabolic improvements without compromising safety.

This study assessed rates of, patient profiles, and associations with morbidity/mortality of renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RASi), angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNi), beta-blockers (BBL), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) withdrawal in patients with HF with improved EF. METHODS: Patients with a first recorded EF <40% and a later EF ≥40% from the Swedish HF registry between June 11, 2000, and December 31, 2023, were included in this retrospective observational study. Withdrawal was defined as a patient on treatment at the first (reduced) but not at the second (improved) registration. The association between withdrawal and time to first cardiovascular mortality/hospitalization for HF with censoring at 1 year was assessed by Cox regression model using overlap weighting. RESULTS: Of 8728 patients with HF with improved EF (median age, 70 years [25th to 75th percentile, 61-78], 2611 [29.9%] women), 96%, 94%, and 46% received RASi/ARNi, BBL, and MRA, respectively, when EF was <40%. The withdrawal rates at the time of the improved EF registration were 4.4% for RASi/ARNi, 3.3% for BBL, and 17.2% for MRA. Predictors of withdrawal included lower use of other HF medications, higher EF at the later EF registration, and a longer time between the 2 EF assessments. After weighting, withdrawal was independently associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular mortality/hospitalization for HF by 38% for RASi/ARNi and 36% for MRA, but not for BBL. Withdrawal of BBL was associated with a higher risk of the primary outcome in the subgroup of patients with an improved EF of 40% to 49% versus ≥50% (P-interaction 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HF with improved EF, HF therapy withdrawal was rare. Withdrawing RASi/ARNi and MRA was associated with higher mortality/morbidity at 1 year. No association was found for BBL withdrawal, albeit with a significant heterogeneity for EF at improvement, suggesting better outcomes with continuing BBL only until EF improves up to 50%. These results are hypothesis-generating and highlight the need for randomized controlled trials testing BBL withdrawal in patients with HF with improved EF.",17/03/2025,Circulation

However, dysregulated copper metabolism in tumor cells maintains homeostatic copper balance, while hypoxic microenvironments hinder therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we present a nanozyme system, termed CussOMEp, comprising a copper-based nanovector (CussNV) that is PEGylated and loaded with omeprazole, a copper transporter inhibitor, to enhance tumor synergistic immunotherapy by promoting cuproptosis and ferroptosis. CussNV is assembled from dithiodiglycolic acid and copper ions, exhibiting peroxidase, glutathione oxidase, and catalase-like activities, along with responsive degradability. This nanozyme alleviates tumor hypoxia by producing oxygen, induces ferroptosis through the generation of lethal hydroxyl radicals, and depletes glutathione. Additionally, omeprazole increases cellular copper concentration and oxidative stress by inhibiting the intracellular copper-transporting ATPase 1 (ATP7A), enhancing lipoylated protein oligomerization and cuproptosis. In a breast tumor mouse model, CussOMEp elicits robust antitumor immune responses, including dendritic cell maturation and T cell proliferation. When combined with PD-1 antibodies (αPD-1), CussOMEp significantly inhibits tumor metastasis in bilateral and lung metastatic models. This work presents a functional nanozyme system as a promising strategy for synergistic tumor immunotherapy leveraging ferroptosis and cuproptosis.",14/12/2024,Journal of nanobiotechnology

However, the role of palmitoylation in Parkinson's disease (PD) has not been systematically investigated. Additionally, findings on DNA methylation changes and PD-associated gene expression remain inconsistent. This study aims to explore the causal relationship and mechanisms between palmitoylation genes, DNA methylation, and PD using Mendelian Randomization (MR). This study employed two-sample MR analysis, summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) analysis, and mediation analysis, utilizing PD GWAS data from the Finngen database, palmitoylation genes data from the eQTLGen database, and DNA methylation data from the GoDMC database. First, a two-sample MR analysis was used to evaluate the causal relationship between the palmitoylation genes and PD. Then, the SMR method was applied to validate the association between gene expression and PD. Finally, mediation analysis was conducted to explore the mediating effect of DNA methylation on the relationship between expression of palmitoylation genes and PD. Our study found a significant positive correlation between high expression of the ZDHHC13 gene and increased PD risk. Each 1 standard deviation increase in ZDHHC13 expression was associated with a 24.20% increase in PD risk. Further DNA methylation analysis identified two key methylation sites (cg00161556 and cg27379915), which indirectly influenced the occurrence of PD by regulating the expression of the ZDHHC13 gene. Mediation effect analysis revealed that the methylation sites cg00161556 and cg27379915 indirectly promoted the development of PD by regulating the expression of the ZDHHC13 gene, with the mediation effect of ZDHHC13 gene expression accounting for 63.72% and 57.61% of the total effect, respectively. Sensitivity analysis and SMR analysis supported our findings, indicating high statistical robustness. This study highlights the role of DNA methylation in regulating ZDHHC13 during PD progression, suggesting potential clinical applications such as ZDHHC13 as a biomarker or therapeutic target for early PD diagnosis and treatment.",09/01/2025,Molecular neurobiology

However, the mechanisms governing epithelial cell survival in nasal polyps (NPs) remains poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the ferroptosis of nasal epithelial cell and its implications in the pathogenesis of NPs. METHODS: The cell death, lipid peroxidation, and ferrous iron levels in nasal epithelial cells were determined by flow cytometry. Biomarkers and signaling pathways associated with ferroptosis were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR, single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing, immunofluorescence staining, and western blotting. Human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) and 16HBE cells were stimulated with different agents. Mitochondrial ultrastructure in HNECs were visualized by transmission electron microscopy. Cytokine levels were quantified using ELISA. A cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-induced mouse model was established and treated with deferoxamine. RESULTS: Nasal epithelial cells from both eosinophilic and noneosinophilic NPs showed intensified lipid peroxidation and altered mitochondrial morphology, resembling the features of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis triggered C-X-C motif ligand (CXCL)8 production in 16HBE cells and HNECs through the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. CSE exposure elevated ferrous iron levels by upregulating transferrin receptor 1, led to ferroptosis and subsequent CXCL8 production in HNECs. Deferoxamine treatment inhibited nasal epithelial cell ferroptosis, CXCL8 levels, and neutrophilic numbers in a CSE-induced mice model. Smoking burden was correlated with CXCL8 levels and neutrophil infiltration in patients with NPs. An analysis of 494,176 UK Biobank participants revealed smoking as a risk factor for NPs (Odds Ratio: 1.346, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.245-1.456, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Smoking-induced ferroptosis promotes CXCL8 production in nasal epithelial cells and thus potentially exacerbates neutrophilic inflammation in NPs.",02/09/2024,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology

This policy is a milestone in China to mitigate serious air pollution. However, health benefits attributable to reduced fine-particulate air pollution after the implementation of the APPCAP have not been quantitatively estimated on a PM(2.5) constituent-specific and morbidity cause-specific basis. Here we conducted a nationwide case-crossover study based on hospital admission records in 292 Chinese cities during 2013-2017. Compared with 2013, the annual average concentrations of PM(2.5) and black carbon (BC) in 2017 decreased by 28.61% and 20.35%, respectively. As a result, the average relative reductions in annual attributable fractions of nine major cause-specific hospital admissions associated with PM(2.5) and BC were 30.00% and 21.14%, respectively, among which annual attributable fraction for depression showed the largest reduction. Nationally, cities with higher reductions in PM(2.5) and BC were found to have higher absolute reductions in annual hospital admission attributable fractions associated with PM(2.5) and BC, and geographic inequality in health benefits still existed.

Initial exome sequencing approaches have failed to identify any single frequent (>25%) mutation in the coding genome. However, using whole-genome sequencing (WGS), we found that one of the genomic regions most frequently mutated (62% of the MM patients) was the 5' untranslated (UTR) region and/or intron 1 of the BCL7A gene. RNA-seq data from a large cohort suggests a loss of BCL7A expression in a large majority of MM patients as compared to normal plasma cells. BCL7A loss of function in a panel of MM cell lines led to a highly proliferative phenotype in vitro and in vivo, while its ectopic expression significantly reduced cell viability, suggesting a tumor suppressor function for BCL7A in MM. We studied the cellular and molecular effects of BCL7A loss and observed that it endows myeloma cells with proliferative potential in cooperation with the plasma cell-defining transcription factor IRF4. BCL7A is involved in a direct protein-protein interaction with IRF4, limiting its DNA binding activity. Loss of BCL7A thus enhances the expression of IRF4-associated cytokines and reduces mitochondrial metabolism and ROS levels. Our study therefore suggests that BCL7A loss provides the necessary molecular change to allow IRF4-mediated transcriptional activity and MM cell growth and survival.",24/01/2025,Blood

This connection arises from significant similarities in their pathological processes, including the regulation of cellular metabolism, inflammation, coagulation, hypoxia, angiogenesis, and neural repair, all of which involve common biological factors. A significant shared feature of both diseases is the crucial role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in mediating intercellular communication. Extracellular vesicles, with their characteristic bilayer structure, encapsulate proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, shielding them from enzymatic degradation by ribonucleases, deoxyribonucleases, and proteases. This structural protection facilitates long-distance intercellular communication in multicellular organisms. In gliomas, EVs are pivotal in intracranial signaling and shaping the tumor microenvironment. Importantly, the cargos carried by glioma-derived EVs closely align with the biological factors involved in ischemic stroke, underscoring the substantial impact of glioma on stroke pathology, particularly through the crucial roles of EVs as key mediators in this interaction. This review explores the pathological interplay between glioma and ischemic stroke, addressing clinical manifestations and pathophysiological processes across the stages of hypoxia, stroke onset, progression, and recovery, with a particular focus on the crucial role of EVs and their cargos in these interactions.",12/01/2025,Journal of neuroinflammation

Meckel's cartilage (MC) is a temporary structure that supports the formation of the mandible, but how MC is involved in the ossification of the mandible is poorly understood. Through the use of single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell spatial transcriptomics analyses, a spatiotemporal atlas of MC in human fetuses from 7 to 15 wk postconception was established, highlighting the role of MC in the ossification of the mandible. Importantly, we revealed that two populations of MC contributed to mandibular ossification through different mechanisms. The anterior MC can differentiate into osteolineage cells, as shown in an in vivo lineage tracing mouse model. The intermediate MC facilitates intramembranous ossification through cell-cell communications, possibly through signaling ligands like BMP5, BMP7, SEMA3A, PDGFC, and FGF7. This study suggests that MC plays a crucial role in mediating mandibular ossification through distinct mechanisms, providing valuable insights for understanding oral and craniofacial diseases and disorders in the future.",17/03/2025,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America

Defects in this gene have been implicated in immunodeficiency. OBJECTIVE: To deepen the understanding of the clinical implications of IRF2BP2 variants, we sought to clinically characterize and functionally test thirty-four individuals with IRF2BP2 variants. METHODS: We collected 34 subjects across 18 families with mutations in IRF2BP2. Records were abstracted for clinical phenotypes. Functional testing was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) luciferase gene reporter constructs and quantitative cDNA determinations were used to evaluate repressor activity associated with ectopic expression of various IRF2BP2 mutant constructs in Jurkat cells. RESULTS: Most subjects had immunodeficiency (91%, n = 30/33) with variable gastrointestinal (65%, n= 20/31) and inflammatory or autoimmune features (57%, n=17/30), including chronic abdominal pain, colitis, diarrhea, constipation, vitiligo, alopecia, and migratory rashes. There was a reduced frequency of memory B-cells with poor immunoglobulin production and reduced calcium flux in response to B-cell receptor stimuli. PBMCs had increased apoptosis in vitro compared to healthy controls. Impaired IRF2BP2 repression of NFAT activation was observed using patient-derived mutant IRF2BP2 constructs compared to wild-type. Similarly, TNF-α transcript levels were higher using patient-derived mutations compared to wild-type IRF2BP2 constructs. CONCLUSIONS: IRF2BP2 deficiency causes a complex immunodeficiency including gastrointestinal and inflammatory disorders as well as impaired B-cell maturation. Impaired repression of the NFAT pathway appears to enhance proinflammatory signaling through proinflammatory cytokine expression.",30/11/2023,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology

Here, we reveal that STING signaling induces PD-L1(hi) tumor monocytes (Tu.Mons) that dominate the resistance against STING agonist therapy. Cell-intrinsic PD-L1, induced by the STING-IRF3-IFN-I axis, is identified as the driving factor for protumoral PD-L1(hi) Tu.Mons. Notably, TLR2-activated Tu.Mons resist STING-induced upregulation of cell-intrinsic PD-L1 and the associated protumoral functions. Mechanistically, TLR2 stimulation remodels STING signaling by facilitating STING and TRAF6 interaction, which suppresses the IRF3-IFN-I response and enhances NF-κB activation. Moreover, we demonstrate that combining STING agonists with TLR2 agonist pretreatment significantly improves antitumor efficacy in murine syngeneic and humanized models. Our findings uncover a protumoral aspect of STING activation mediated by cell-intrinsic PD-L1 and propose a promising strategy to boost antitumor immunity by fine-tuning STING signaling outputs.",30/07/2024,Cancer cell

However, our understanding of the splenic niche is very limited. Herein, we report that induced expression of the secreted protein Gremlin 1 in a mouse model restrains chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) progression and synergizes with tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment, whereas blockade of Gremlin 1 promotes CML development. Intriguingly, the effect of Gremlin 1 is most evident in the spleen but not in the bone marrow. Gremlin 1 induces apoptosis of leukemic stem cells via antagonizing the BMP pathway. Single-cell RNA sequencing and experimental validation together show that Gremlin 1 marks a unique stromal cell population in the spleens of both mice and humans. Genetic ablation of Gremlin 1(+) cells leads to accelerated CML progression. Collectively, Gremlin 1 and Gremlin 1(+) cells are key defensive niche components in the spleen that limit CML progression, revealing an unprecedented mechanism for the body to fight off leukemia.",09/04/2024,Nature cancer

Hepatic phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), the rate-limiting enzyme of the serine biosynthesis pathway, regulates MAFLD development. However, the role of macrophage PHGDH in MAFLD progression remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the lipotoxicity inducer palmitic acid (PA) significantly increases macrophage PHGDH expression and that PHGDH deficiency in macrophages promotes PA-induced inflammatory responses. Myeloid-specific PHGDH deficiency exacerbates MAFLD in mice. Mechanistically, tetrameric PHGDH binds to transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) to inhibit its interaction with TAK1 binding protein 1 (TAB1), sequentially suppressing the activation of TAK1 and downstream NF-κB and MAPK signaling. Inhibition of TAK1 activation slows the development of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) caused by myeloid PHGDH knockout. Importantly, adeno-associated virus-mediated PHGDH overexpression in liver macrophages alleviates MAFLD in mice. Collectively, these results identify macrophage PHGDH as a promising therapeutic agent for MAFLD.",23/07/2024,Cell reports

Ruxolitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) 1/2 inhibitor, has shown promise in treating HLH and exerts synergistic effects when combined with dexamethasone. Our pilot study preliminarily demonstrated that the combination of ruxolitinib and dexamethasone (the Ru-D regimen) had a high response rate and led to favorable short-term survival outcomes in adult HLH patients. In this prospective phase 2 clinical trial, we propose the Ru-D regimen as a first-line treatment for adults newly diagnosed with HLH with unknown triggers (chictr.org.cn identifier: ChiCTR2100049996). A total of 28 Chinese patients were enrolled, and the median follow-up time was 25.1 months (range, 0.87-34.0). The 2-month OS rate (the primary endpoint) was 85.7%, which exceeded our expected 2-month OS rate of 75%. The 6-month and 2-year OS rates were 67.9% (19/28) and 53.6% (15/28), respectively. The median OS of lymphoma-associated HLH (LAHS) patients was 5.8 months, and most of these patients had NK/T-cell lymphoma. In contrast, the 2-year OS rate of non-LAHS patients was 75%. The overall response rate (ORR) was 85.7% (24/28); 17.9% (5/28) of patients achieved a complete response (CR) during the Ru-D regimen. Overall, the Ru-D regimen was well tolerated in HLH patients.

Fully understanding the cellular heterogeneity and immune adaptations in response to anti-PD-1 therapy is necessary to design more effective immunotherapies for GBM. This study aimed to dissect the molecular mechanisms of specific immunosuppressive subpopulations to drive anti-PD-1 resistance in GBM. METHODS: We systematically analysed single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics data from GBM tissues receiving anti-PD-1 therapy to characterize the microenvironment alterations. The biological functions of a novel circular RNA (circRNA) were validated both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, co-immunoprecipitation, RNA immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays were conducted. RESULTS: Mesenchymal GBM (MES-GBM) cells, which were associated with a poor prognosis, and secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1)(+) myeloid-derived macrophages (SPP1(+) MDMs), a unique subpopulation of MDMs with complex functions, preferentially accumulated in non-responders to anti-PD-1 therapy, indicating that MES-GBM cells and SPP1(+) MDMs were the main anti-PD-1-resistant cell subpopulations. Functionally, we determined that circular RNA succinate dehydrogenase complex assembly factor 2 (circSDHAF2), which was positively associated with the abundance of these two anti-PD-1-resistant cell subpopulations, facilitated the formation of a regional MES-GBM and SPP1(+) MDM cell interaction loop, resulting in a spatially specific adaptive immunosuppressive microenvironment. Mechanically, we found that circSDHAF2 promoted MES-GBM cell formation by stabilizing the integrin alpha 5 (ITGA5) protein through N-glycosylation. Meanwhile, the N-glycosylation of the ITGA5 protein facilitated its translocation into exosomes and subsequent delivery to MDMs to induce the formation of SPP1(+) MDMs, which in turn maintained the MES-GBM cell status and induced T-cell dysfunction via the SPP1-ITGA5 pathway, ultimately promoting GBM immune escape. Importantly, our findings demonstrated that antibody-mediated ITGA5 blockade enhanced anti-PD-1-mediated antitumor immunity. CONCLUSIONS: This work elucidated the potential tissue adaptation mechanism of intratumoral dynamic interactions between MES-GBM cells, MDMs and T cells in anti-PD-1 non-responders and identified the therapeutic potential of targeting ITGA5 to reduce anti-PD-1 resistance in GBM.",27/02/2025,"Cancer communications (London, England)"

This research utilized the latest Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) database to evaluate the evolving disease burden of DD in this demographic over the past 3 decades. METHODS: Data on the incidence and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) of DD among people aged 45-89 in China between 1992 and 2021 were collected from the GBD 2021. The age-period-cohort (APC) model was applied to determine the effects of age, period, and cohort on the incidence and DALY rates of DD. RESULTS: (1) Over the last 30 years, there was a 6.49% increase in the overall age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and a 3.99% increase in age-standardized DALY rates (ASDR) for DD among middle-aged and older adults in China, with females consistently exhibiting higher ASIR and ASDR than males. In 2020, COVID-19 significantly increased the ASIR and ASDR of DD in the population, especially in females. (2) The APC analysis revealed an annual net drift of 0.38% in incidence and 0.17% in DALY rate. For both genders, local drifts of incidence were negative for the 45-54 age group and positive for the 55-89 age group; DALY rates showed negative local drifts for the 45-59 age group and positive for the 60-89 age group. (3) Incidence and DALY rates increased with age, displaying a trend of initial decline followed by an increase in period effects, but a trend of initial increase followed by a decrease in cohort effects. Moreover, the impacts of age, period, and cohort exhibited gender differences. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide a comprehensive and in-depth perspective for studying the changing trends of DD's burden in China and for identifying targeted prevention and treatment policies for DD from different aspects.",29/01/2025,International journal of geriatric psychiatry

Increasing evidence shows that obesity contributes to IVDD, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we firstly revealed a causal correlation between obesity and IVDD via a two-sample mendelian randomization analysis and identified fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) as the potential regulator to associate IVDD and obesity. Elevated FABP4 expression promoted extracellular matrix (ECM) disequilibrium and angiogenesis to exacerbate IVDD progression. Genetically knocking out or pharmacologically inhibiting FABP4 in high-fat diet-induced mice alleviated IVDD. Mechanistically, obesity activated the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which upregulated FABP4 expression, leading to the accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) in intervertebral disc tissue. AGEs further activated the NF-κB signalling pathway, exacerbating ECM degradation and neovascularization. Conversely, rapamycin-mediated inhibition of mTORC1 suppressed FABP4 expression in nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs), alleviating IVDD in vivo. Collectively, our findings reveal a critical role of the obesity-induced mTORC1-FABP4 axis in ECM degradation and angiogenesis during IVDD progression. Targeting FABP4 may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for IVDD in obese individuals.",16/02/2025,Cell proliferation

DESIGN: Open label, randomised, controlled feasibility study. SETTING: Single-centre research institute in New Zealand recruiting participants from the community. PARTICIPANTS: 30 adult participants with symptoms of a common cold, presenting within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive either 35 L/min of 100% humidified air at 41°C via high flow nasal cannulae, 2 hours per day for up to 5 days (rhinothermy), or vitamin C 250 mg daily for 5 days (control). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the proportion of screened candidates who were randomised. Secondary outcomes included: proportion of randomised participants who completed the study; modified Jackson scores from randomisation to 10 days after initiation of randomised regimen; time until feeling 'a lot better' compared with study entry; time until resolution of symptoms or symptom score at 10 days postrandomisation; proportion of organisms identified by PCR analysis of nasal swabs taken at baseline; the patterns of use of the rhinothermy device; estimated adherence of the control group; and rhinothermy device tolerability. RESULTS: In all 30/79 (38%, 95% CI 27% to 50%) of potential participants screened for eligibility were randomised. Rhinothermy was well tolerated, and all randomised participants completed the study (100%, 95% CI 88% to 100%). The reduction from baseline in the modified Jackson score was greater with rhinothermy compared with control at days 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, with the maximum difference at day 4 (-6.4, 95% CI -9.4 to -3.3). The substantial clinical benefit threshold for modified Jackson score was a 5-unit change.

Thus, it is important to assess whether available fluid biomarkers can successfully stage AD into clinically and biologically relevant categories. In the TRIAD cohort, we explored whether p-tau217, p-tau205 and NTA-tau (biomarkers of early, intermediate and late AD pathology, respectively) have potential for biofluid-based staging in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; n = 219) and plasma (n = 150), and compared them in a paired CSF and plasma subset (n = 76). Our findings suggest a good concordance between biofluid staging and underlying pathology when classifying amyloid-positivity into three categories based on neurofibrillary pathology: minimal/non-existent (p-tau217 positive), early-to-intermediate (p-tau217 and p-tau205 positivity), and advanced tau tangle deposition (p-tau217, p-tau205 and NTA-tau positive), as indexed by tau-PET. Discordant cases accounted for 4.6% and 13.3% of all CSF and plasma measurements respectively (9.2% and 11.8% in paired samples). Notably, CSF- and plasma-based staging matched one another in 61.7% of the cases, while approximately 32% of the remaining participants were one to three biofluid stages higher in CSF as compared to plasma. Overall, these exploratory results suggest that biofluid staging of AD holds potential for offering valuable insights into underlying AD hallmarks and disease severity.

Recent studies have highlighted the potential of gut microbiota-derived metabolites in modulating cardiac outcomes. Here, the cardioprotective effects of a commensal bacterium Flavonifractor plautii (F. plautii) and its metabolite desaminotyrosine (DAT) against myocardial I/R injury are investigated. We showed that prophylactic gavage of F. plautii attenuates myocardial I/R injury as evidenced by improved cardiac function and reduced cardiac injury. We also found that its metabolite DAT recapitulates these cardioprotective effects against myocardial I/R injury. Transcriptomic analysis has revealed that DAT preserves cardiac tissue and attenuates immune responses against myocardial I/R injury. Mechanistically, DAT promotes cardiomyocyte survival through the modulation of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP(+)/NADPH) ratio. Further, DAT suppressed macrophage proinflammatory activities and cardiac inflammation via the reduction in interleukin-6 (IL-6) production.

Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) represent the common progenitor to myofibroblasts that produce extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins to mediate liver fibrosis. In the present study, we investigated the role of Pre-B-Cell leukemia transcription factor 1 (PBX1) in this process. METHODS: Liver fibrosis was induced by CCl4 injection or bile duct ligation (BDL). Cellular transcriptome was examined by RNA-seq and CUT&Tag-seq. RESULTS: PBX1 was screened out of mining through liver fibrosis-related single-cell RNA-seq datasets as the most prominently up-regulated transcription factor during HSC activation. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) coupled with reporter assay and ChIP assay demonstrated that Notch3 mediated elevation of PBX1 expression at the transcriptional level in HSCs. PBX1 knockdown attenuated HSC-myofibroblast transition in vitro and liver fibrosis in mice. Integrated transcriptomic analysis suggested that PBX1 contributed to HSC activation by activating a host of pro-fibrogenic molecules including interleukin 7 receptor (IL7R/CD127). Consistently, exposure to recombinant IL-7 promoted HSC activation whereas IL7R knockdown hampered HSC activation. Mechanistically, IL7R interacted with TGF-β receptors (TβRI/II) to trigger a pro-fibrogenic signaling cascade. Importantly, blockade of the IL-7-IL7R signaling with neutralizing antibodies markedly ameliorated liver fibrosis in mice. Finally, a positive correlation between PBX1, IL7R and HSC activation was identified in cirrhotic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data uncover a previously unappreciated role for PBX1 in HSC activation and provide proof-of-concept for targeting IL-7 signaling in the intervention of liver fibrosis.",15/10/2024,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)"

Therefore, this study is intended to further investigate the association between the NHHR index and the mortality rate of CVDs in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and diabetic kidney disease (DKD). METHODS: The research sample was selected from the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) database, and 5136 individuals were categorized based on quartiles of the NHHR index. Restricted cubic plots and COX regression models were utilized to examine the thresholds and patterns of the NHHR index in relation to the risk of CVDs mortality among T2DM patients as well as those with DKD. Subgroup analyses and p-values were used to evaluate interactions between different variables. RESULTS: The NHHR index shows a nonlinear association with cardiovascular mortality in two patient groups, following an L-shaped pattern. In individuals with T2DM, a lower NHHR index (<1.68) correlates with an increased risk of death, demonstrating a 72.8% reduction in mortality risk for each unit increase in NHHR below this threshold. Similarly, among patients with DKD, a lower NHHR index (<1.82) is associated with heightened cardiovascular mortality risk, indicating a 48.2% reduction in death risk for each unit increase in NHHR beneath the specified threshold. In patients diagnosed with T2DM, the third quartile of the NHHR index was significantly linked to reduced mortality risk; the association remained consistent even when additional variables were considered [Hazard Ratio (HR), 0.82; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) (0.69-0.97); P=0.019]. Among patients with DKD, cardiovascular mortality was notably higher in the third and fourth quartiles of the NHHR index [Quartile3 HR, 1.57; 95% CI (1.10-2.24), P=0.013; Quartile4 HR, 2.04; 95% CI (1.28-3.26), P=0.003]. CONCLUSIONS: The NHHR is below 1.68, and an increase in the NHHR index is associated with a reduced risk of CVD mortality in patients with T2DM. Similarly, when the NHHR falls below 1.82, an elevation in the NHHR index correlates with a decreased risk of CVD mortality in patients with DKD.",11/10/2024,Frontiers in endocrinology

However, the available arsenal of E3 ligases for PROTAC development remains underexplored, severely limiting the scope of targeted protein degradation. In this study, we identify a non-inhibitory aptamer targeting ZYG11B, a substrate receptor of the Cullin 2-RING ligase complex, as an E3 warhead for targeted protein degradation. This aptamer-based PROTAC platform, termed ZATAC, is facilely produced through bioorthogonal chemistry or self-assembly and shows promise in eliminating several undruggable target proteins, including nucleolin (NCL), SRY-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2), and mutant p53-R175H, underscoring its universality and versatility. To specifically deliver ZATACs into cancer cells, we further develop DNA three-way junction-based ZATACs (3WJ-ZATACs) by integrating an additional aptamer that selectively recognizes the protein overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells.

Here our analysis combining CRISPR‒Cas9 screening with single-cell RNA sequencing tracking of tumor transition demonstrated that antiandrogen-induced zinc finger MYND-type containing 8 (ZMYND8)-dependent epigenetic programming orchestrates NEPC transdifferentiation. Ablation of Zmynd8 prevents NEPC development, while ZMYND8 upregulation mediated by achaete-scute homolog 1 promotes NEPC differentiation. We show that forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1) stabilizes ZMYND8 binding to chromatin regions characterized by H3K4me1-H3K14ac modification and FOXM1 targeting. Antiandrogen therapy releases the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex from the androgen receptor, facilitating its interaction with ZMYND8-FOXM1 to upregulate critical neuroendocrine lineage regulators. We develop iZMYND8-34, a small molecule designed to inhibit ZMYND8's histone recognition, which effectively blocks NEPC development. These findings reveal the critical role of ZMYND8-dependent epigenetic programming induced by androgen deprivation therapy in orchestrating lineage fate. Targeting ZMYND8 emerges as a promising strategy for impeding NEPC development.",01/02/2024,Nature cancer

However, acquired resistance to these targeted therapies remains a major challenge. Understanding the mechanisms underlying acquired resistance will be crucial for the development of strategies that might either overcome this effect or delay the onset. Circulating tumour DNA, owing to the need for only minimally invasive sampling and a potential role as both a prognostic and predictive biomarker, is increasingly being used in both research and clinical practice. Several studies have explored the landscape of acquired resistance to targeted therapies using this approach. However, the methodologies of the published studies vary widely, and several major challenges remain in addressing the practical difficulties associated with these methods. These challenges currently limit the depth of research insight provided by the available data. In this Perspective, we review clinical reports describing the use of circulating tumour DNA to detect mechanisms of acquired resistance to targeted therapies, predominantly in patients with advanced-stage non-small-cell lung cancer, and highlight key unresolved questions with the aim of moving towards more-informative research studies.",27/02/2025,Nature reviews.

Inhibition of p40, a subunit of IL-12/IL-23, attenuates pathology in AD-like mice; however, its signaling mechanism and expression pattern remained elusive. Here we show that IL-12 receptors are predominantly expressed in neurons and oligodendrocytes in AD-like APPPS1 mice and in patients with AD, whereas IL-23 receptor transcripts are barely detectable. Consistently, deletion of the IL-12 receptor in neuroectodermal cells ameliorated AD pathology in APPPS1 mice, whereas removal of IL-23 receptors had no effect. Genetic ablation of IL-12 signaling alone reverted the loss of mature oligodendrocytes, restored myelin homeostasis, rescued the amyloid-β-dependent reduction of parvalbumin-positive interneurons and restored phagocytosis-related changes in microglia of APPPS1 mice. Furthermore, IL-12 protein expression was increased in human AD brains compared to healthy age-matched controls, and human oligodendrocyte-like cells responded profoundly to IL-12 stimulation. We conclude that oligodendroglial and neuronal IL-12 signaling, but not IL-23 signaling, are key in orchestrating AD-related neuroimmune crosstalk and that IL-12 represents an attractive therapeutic target in AD.",12/04/2024,Nature aging

However, the physiological regulation and function of this process in the context of mature in vivo memory circuits has remained unclear. Here, we combined synaptosome RNA profiling with whole brain high-resolution imaging to uncover mRNAs with different localization patterns in the axons of Drosophila Mushroom Body memory neurons, some exhibiting regionalized, input-dependent, recruitment along axons. By integrating transcriptome-wide binding approaches and functional assays, we show that the conserved Imp RNA binding protein controls the transport of mRNAs to Mushroom Body axons and characterize a mutant in which this transport is selectively impaired. Using this unique mutant, we demonstrate that axonal mRNA localization is required for long-term, but not short-term, behavioral memory.

There is a lack of literature comparing the efficacy and safety of both these agents in people with obesity/overweight with or without type 2 diabetes (T2D). We systematically reviewed Phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted with two agents to synthesize the comparative efficacy and safety outcomes. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed electronic databases until December 15, 2024, using selected keywords and Boolean ""AND."" Subsequently, we compared the most closely matched trials conducted with semaglutide 2.4 mg and tirzepatide through an adjusted (if baseline imbalance in treatment outcome modifiers present) or unadjusted (in the absence of baseline imbalance) indirect treatment comparison method. RESULTS: We identified one trial each of semaglutide 2.4 mg (STEP-1) and tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg (SURMOUNT-1) in obese or overweight people without T2D and one trial each of semaglutide 2.4 mg (STEP-2) and tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg (SURMOUNT-2) in overweight people with T2D that were almost entirely comparable concerning baseline outcome modifier characteristics. Our unadjusted analysis without individual patients' data found relatively higher (4 and 5.4 % additional) weight loss, HbA1c (-0.4 % additional) reduction, and fewer gastrointestinal side effects (GI S/E) with tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg, respectively, than with semaglutide 2.4 mg, in the intention-to-treat analysis. CONCLUSION: Tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg are more effective and have fewer GI S/E than semaglutide 2.4 mg. A well-powered head-to-head RCT is currently needed to confirm these findings.",27/01/2025,Diabetes & metabolic syndrome

This balance and protection from stressors is maintained through interactions both within the bacterial ecosystem as well as with its host. As a consequence, the gut microbiome plays a critical role in various physiological processes including maintaining the structure and function of the gut barrier, educating the gut immune system, and modulating the gut motor, digestive/absorptive, as well as neuroendocrine system all of which are crucial for human health and disease pathogenesis. Pre- and probiotics, widely available and clinically established, offer various health benefits primarily by beneficially modulating the gut microbiome. However, their clinical outcomes can vary significantly due to differences in host physiology, diets, individual microbiome compositions, and other environmental factors. This perspective paper highlights emerging scientific insights into the importance of microbial micronutrient sharing, gut redox balance, keystone species, and the gut barrier in maintaining a diverse and functional microbial ecosystem, and their relevance to human health. We propose a novel approach that targets microbial ecosystems and keystone taxa performance by supplying microbial micronutrients in the form of colon-delivered vitamins, and precision prebiotics [e.g. human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) or synthetic glycans] as components of precisely tailored ingredient combinations to optimize human health. Such a strategy may effectively support and stabilize microbial ecosystems, providing a more robust and consistent approach across various individuals and environmental conditions, thus, overcoming the limitations of current single biotic solutions.",17/03/2025,Gut microbes

We performed single cell RNA-sequencing of fresh cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and parallel blood samples of 15 patients with LGI1- (n=9) and CASPR2-AIE (n=6) compared to control patients (multiple sclerosis (MS) n=15, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) n=18).

Compared to IIH and MS controls, we observed clonal CSF-specific ASC expansion in LGI1/CASPR2-AIE despite mostly normal CSF findings. ASCs were dominantly plasmablasts and transcribed IgG4 and IgG1/2 heavy chains. Expanded clones showed signs of affinity maturation and bound the respective neuronal autoantigen. Within CD4 and CD8 T cell clusters, CD4 and CD8 central memory T cells were activated, clonally restricted and expanded. T cell clones were often shared between CSF and blood. We also observed a shift of NK cells and loss of mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in the CSF of LGI1- and blood of LGI1- and CASPR2-AIE compared to IIH and MS controls. Indeed, MAIT-like T cells were detected in autopsy brains of LGI1 and CASPR2-AIE patients and mice lacking MAIT cells displayed an increased antibody seroconversion and higher titers following active LGI1-/CASPR2 immunization. Our data (1) confirms the intrathecal antigen-specific plasma cell expansion in LGI1- and CASPR2-AIE in a large cohort of untreated AIE patients, (2) suggests that activated and expanded central memory CD4 and CD8 T cells in the CSF participate in disease pathogenesis and (3) for the first time implicates invariant T cell receptor expressing lymphocytes in the brain, CSF and blood in disease pathogenesis.",23/03/2024,Brain : a journal of neurology

Recent studies indicate a role of loss of the HLA class-I antigen presentation machinery (APM) protein β-2-microglobulin in acquired resistance to immune checkpoint blockers. However, the mechanisms, functional consequences and therapeutic potential of APM defects in NSCLC remain poorly understood. METHODS: Using multiplexed immunofluorescence, we spatially mapped CD8(+) effector Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) and the APM components TAP1 and TAP2 in 819 baseline/pre-treatment NSCLCs from patients treated with and without PD-1 axis blockers in 4 independent cohorts. The impact of TAP1/2 silencing in lung cancer cells using siRNAs and CRISPR/Cas9 was studied using transcriptomic analysis, phosphoprotein arrays, ATAC-sequencing, measurement of surface HLA-peptide complexes and in vitro tumor-antigen specific T-cell killing. We established autologous co-cultures of tumor and immune cells from primary human NSCLCs to study the functional impact of IL4Rα and/or PD-1 blockade using monoclonal antibodies. A high-throughput drug screen supported the identification of compounds able to increase TAP2 expression in NSCLC cells. RESULTS: We identified cancer cell selective TAP2 protein downregulation in 42.4% of treatment naïve NSCLCs associated with reduced sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockers. TAP1 downregulation occurred in 24.4% of lung tumors without survival impact. Silencing of TAP2 in lung cancer cells altered key intracellular immunomodulatory pathways, limited sensitivity to proinflammatory cytokines, reduced the levels of surface peptide-HLA complexes and protected malignant cells from tumor antigen-specific T-cell killing via SOCS1 upregulation. TAP2 loss in human NSCLCs was associated with reduced TAP2 promoter chromatin accessibility and elevated IL-4 IL-4 expression. Treatment with IL-4 reduced TAP2 levels and the chromatin accessibility of the TAP2 gene promoter in NSCLC cells and reproduced all the functional consequences of TAP2 loss. In intact human NSCLC, IL-4 IL-4 transcripts were detected in intratumoral myeloid cells and IL-4Rα blockade increased human NSCLC cell killing by autologous TILs.

10.1136/jitc-2024-010639,Protein arginine methyltransferase 6 enhances immune checkpoint blockade efficacy via the STING pathway in MMR-proficient colorectal cancer.,"Duan, Jinlin,Chen, Tao,Li, Qiwei,Zhang, Yu,Lu, Ting,Xue, Junyan,Sun, Yang,Gao, Ling,Zhang, Yonglong","BACKGROUND: The emergence of immunotherapy has revolutionized the paradigm of cancer treatment with immune checkpoint blockades (ICB) in solid cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, only a small subset of CRC patients harboring deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) benefits from ICB therapy. A very limited response to ICB therapy has been achieved in MMR-proficient CRC, representing a significant challenge limiting the clinical application of immunotherapy. MMR is the critical DNA repair pathway that maintains genomic integrity by correcting DNA mismatches, which is mediated by the MutSα or MutSβ complex consisting of MSH2 with MSH6 and MSH3, respectively. Given that MMR status directs effective immune response, we sought to determine whether targeting MMR capacity boosts ICB efficacy. METHODS: Azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS)-induced CRC and xenograft model were used to evaluate the function of PRMT6 and response to PRMT6 inhibitor EPZ020411 and combination therapy of PD1 and EPZ020411. Biochemical assays were performed to elucidate the underlying mechanism of PRMT6-mediated MSH2 methylation and immune evasion. RESULTS: We have identified PRMT6 as a crucial regulator of MMR capacity via MSH2 dimethylation at R171 and R219. Such a modification abrogates its MMR capacity and prevents the recruitment of MSH3 and MSH6. PRMT6 loss or inhibition triggers cytosolic DNA accumulation and cGAS-STING signaling activation, leading to enhanced immune response in PRMT6-deficient colon tumors or xenografts. Pharmacological inhibition of PRMT6 using EPZ020411 promotes mutagenesis and destabilizes MutSα or MutSβ assembly, and prolonged EPZ020411 exposure maintains an MSI-like phenotype in microsatellite stability (MSS) cells. EPZ020411 treatment sensitizes ICB efficacy of MSS cells, but not MSI cells in vivo. Similar effects have been observed in MSS colon tumors induced by AOM/DSS. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a preclinical proof of concept to overcome resistance to immunotherapy by targeting PRMT6 in CRC with MSS.",26/02/2025,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer

However, systematic tracking of the brain regions associated with the input and output of the heart is lacking. In this study, we injected retrograde transsynaptic pseudorabies virus (PRV) and anterograde transsynaptic herpes simplex virus (HSV) into the left ventricular wall of mice to identify the whole-brain regions associated with the input to and output from the heart. We successfully detected PRV and HSV expression in at least 170 brain subregions in both male and female mice. Sex differences were discovered mainly in the hypothalamus and medulla, with male mice exhibiting greater correlation and hierarchical clustering than female mice, indicating reduced similarity and increased modularity of virus expression patterns in male mice. Further graph theory and multiple linear regression analysis of different injection timelines revealed that hub regions of PRV had highly similar clusters, with different brain levels, suggesting a top-down, hierarchically transmitted neural control pattern of the heart. Hub regions of HSV had scattered clusters, with brain regions gathered in the cortex and brainstem, suggesting a bottom-up, leapfrog, multipoint neural sensing pattern of the heart. Both patterns contain many hub brain regions that have been previously overlooked in brain‒heart axis studies. These results provide brain targets for future research and will lead to deeper insight into the brain mechanisms involved in specific heart conditions.",04/11/2024,Neuroscience bulletin

METHODS: Imaging mass cytometry was conducted on 66 NSCLC tumors, 44 of which had EGFR mutations. We correlated clinical variables, including overall survival, with CD105 (endoglin) expression, a co-receptor for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Two osimertinib-resistant EGFR-mutant cell lines were developed to study the effects of EGFR and CD105 disruption. Single cell RNA sequencing of the isogenic parental and osimertinib resistant lines was performed. Additionally, ATAC sequencing and Single Cell ENergetIc metabolism by profiling Translation inHibition analysis (SCENITH) was used to assess promoter chromatin status and glycolytic state. RESULTS: We found a negative correlation between CD105 expression and overall survival in patients. Treatment with osimertinib or EGFR knockdown significantly elevated CD105 expression in EGFR-mutant cell lines. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified a subset of cells with heightened endothelial characteristics and altered pyrimidine metabolism, associated with osimertinib resistance. These cells exhibited a slow-cycling behavior, characterized by elevated chromatin condensation and reduced glycolysis. Combining osimertinib with carotuximab, a CD105 neutralizing antibody, significantly reduced the slow-cycling transcriptomic signature, increased chromatin accessibility, and restored glycolysis compared to osimertinib treatment alone. Mass spectrometry confirmed that carotuximab re-engaged EGFR signaling by coupling it with CD105. Consequently, carotuximab re-sensitized resistant tumors to osimertinib by increasing their mitotic index and ERK signaling in mouse models. CONCLUSION: Carotuximab effectively reduced the slow-cycling cell population and restored osimertinib sensitivity, offering a promising strategy for managing refractory NSCLC.",06/11/2024,Drug resistance updates : reviews and commentaries in antimicrobial and        anticancer chemotherapy

Additionally, the therapeutic potential of Fangchinoline, an alkaloid with anticancer properties, has yet to be systematically evaluated. This research investigates Fangchinoline's efficacy in NPC treatment and SQLE-related mechanisms. METHODS: Drug screening in NPC cell lines C666-1 and 5-8F identified potential candidates. IC50 values were determined using CCK-8 assays, and apoptosis, proliferation, and invasion were assessed via Annexin V/PI staining, EdU staining, and Transwell assays. Cholesterol levels were quantified using a TG kit. RNA sequencing with GO/KEGG analyses identified key pathways. Correlation analysis was performed via cBioPortal and GEPIA2 databases, protein interaction networks via STRING and Cytoscape, and survival analysis via Kaplan-Meier curves. Gene and protein expression were validated with qPCR and Western blot, and an NPC mouse model confirmed in vivo efficacy. RESULTS: Fangchinoline inhibited NPC cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and reduced cholesterol accumulation. RNA sequencing revealed that Fangchinoline downregulated SQLE expression, suppressing the PI3K/AKT pathway. Correlation and protein interaction analyses highlighted SQLE's role in NPC progression, and survival analysis confirmed its clinical relevance. By targeting SQLE and disrupting cholesterol metabolism, Fangchinoline suppressed tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo.

Protein ubiquitination plays a pivotal role in cardiovascular diseases. However, the possible contribution of the E3 ubiquitin ligase March2 (membrane-associated RING finger protein 2) to the cause of AAD remains elusive. METHODS: Integrated single-cell RNA sequencing analysis was conducted in human AAD tissues. Based on the screening results, we generated a mouse line of smooth muscle cell-specific March2 knockout. β-Aminopropionitrile monofumarate was used to establish AAD. Cleavage under targets and tagmentation and cleavage under targets and tagmentation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction were performed to identify possible target genes for histone H3K18 lactylation. RESULTS: March2 expression was downregulated in aorta from patients with AAD or β-aminopropionitrile monofumarate-induced AAD mice. β-Aminopropionitrile monofumarate-induced AAD was significantly accentuated in March2 global (March2(-/-)) and vascular smooth muscle cell-specific deletion (March2(fl/fl); Tagln(Cre)) mice, whereas the AAD pathology was rescued by rAAV9-SM22α-March2 (recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 expressing Flag-tagged March2 under SM22α promoter). March2 interacted with PKM2 (pyruvate kinase M2) to promote K33-linked polyubiquitination. Deficiency of March2 lessened PKM2 dimer-to-tetramer conversion in AAD and overtly exacerbated AAD-induced histone H3K18 lactylation in vascular smooth muscle cells by fostering glucose metabolism reprogramming, thereby promoting p53-driven apoptotic transcriptional response-a hallmark of AAD pathogenesis. TEPP-46, a PKM2-specific activator, pronouncedly alleviated March2 deficiency-deteriorated AAD pathology. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that March2 is a novel endogenous defender that prevents AAD by inhibiting vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis, suggesting that March2 represents a potential therapeutic target for AAD.",13/03/2025,Circulation research

Few studies have explored the impact of long-term rate control therapy on levels of troponin in AF patients without coronary heart disease and heart failure. This substudy of the RATe control in Atrial Fibrillation (RATAF) II study aimed to compare the effects of six months' treatment with diltiazem and metoprolol on hs-troponin I (TnI) levels both at rest and during exercise testing in patients with permanent AF. METHODS: This was a parallel-group, randomized, investigator-blinded clinical trial. The cohort consisted of 93 patients (28 women, mean age 71 ± 7 years) with symptomatic, permanent AF with preserved left ventricular systolic function and no coronary heart disease. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either diltiazem 360 mg (n = 49) or metoprolol 100 mg (n = 44) once daily for six months.

Both treatment groups exhibited a decrease in hs-TnI levels at rest (diltiazem p = 0.008, metoprolol p = 0.03) and peak exercise (diltiazem p < 0.001, metoprolol p = 0.004) at six months compared to baseline levels, with no significant differences observed between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with permanent AF, six months of rate control therapy with diltiazem or metoprolol lowered levels of hs-TnI. Further research is warranted to determine whether this reduction translates into an improved prognosis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02695992.

10.7326/ANNALS-24-01917,Acute Pain Management in People With Opioid Use Disorder : A Systematic Review.,"Buonora, Michele J,Mackey, Katherine,Khalid, Laila,Hickey, Thomas R,Grimshaw, Alyssa A,Moss, Max,Starrels, Joanna L,Alford, Daniel P,Becker, William C,Weimer, Melissa B","BACKGROUND: Guidance on acute pain management among people with opioid use disorder (OUD) is limited. PURPOSE: To synthesize evidence on the benefits and harms of acute pain interventions among people with OUD. DATA SOURCES: APA PsycArticles, APA PsycInfo, APA PsycExtra, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Ovid Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and the Web of Science Core Collection through 7 July 2024. STUDY SELECTION: Studies of any design that evaluated acute pain interventions among adults with OUD and included pain or OUD outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION: Independent dual screening, single-investigator data extraction with verification, and dual quality and strength of evidence assessment. DATA SYNTHESIS: Seventeen trials, 20 controlled observational studies, and 78 uncontrolled observational studies met eligibility criteria. Continuing use of buprenorphine during acute pain episodes may be associated with similar or improved pain-related outcomes versus discontinuing, based on cohort studies conducted primarily in perioperative settings. Single well-conducted randomized controlled trials in emergency department (ED) or perioperative settings in adults not prescribed medications for OUD suggest oral clonidine, intramuscular haloperidol and midazolam with intravenous (IV) morphine, and intraoperative IV lidocaine may improve pain outcomes and warrant study in diverse patient populations. Few studies evaluated methadone or the effect of interventions on OUD outcomes. LIMITATIONS: Most evidence is observational and at risk of bias due to confounding. All studies were conducted in ED or hospital settings, most before widespread use of high-potency synthetic opioids or among non-U.S. populations using opium. CONCLUSION: The overall evidence for pain outcomes in people with OUD is low. The effect of pain interventions on OUD outcomes is an important evidence gap. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: None.

To shed light on these in the context of liver function, we perform single-nucleus RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic profiling of livers from 17 COVID-19 decedents. RESULTS: We identify hepatocytes positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA with an expression phenotype resembling infected lung epithelial cells, and a central role in a pro-fibrotic TGFβ signaling cell-cell communications network. Integrated analysis and comparisons with healthy controls reveal extensive changes in the cellular composition and expression states in COVID-19 liver, providing the underpinning of hepatocellular injury, ductular reaction, pathologic vascular expansion, and fibrogenesis characteristic of COVID-19 cholangiopathy. We also observe Kupffer cell proliferation and erythrocyte progenitors for the first time in a human liver single-cell atlas. Despite the absence of a clinical acute liver injury phenotype, endothelial cell composition is dramatically impacted in COVID-19, concomitantly with extensive alterations and profibrogenic activation of reactive cholangiocytes and mesenchymal cells.

This study assesses the long-term effects of air pollution on GI diseases using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). METHODS: This nationwide cohort study utilized CHARLS data from participants recruited in 2011, followed by surveys in 2013, 2015, 2018, and 2020. Long-term exposure to PM(2.5), PM(10), SO(2), NO(2), CO, and O(3) was assessed using geocoded residential addresses linked to air quality data. Cox proportional hazards models and subgroup interaction analyses were used to evaluate associations between pollutants and GI disease incidence, adjusting for demographic and behavioral confounders. RESULTS: The incidence of GI disease was 21.4% among participants. Long-term exposure to PM(2.5) (HR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.33-1.44), PM(10) (HR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.26-1.36), SO(2) (HR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.68-1.81), NO(2) (HR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.17-1.25), CO (HR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.42-1.54), and O(3) (HR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.54-0.59) was significantly associated with GI disease. Interaction analyses showed that the effects of pollutants varied by region, residence, smoking, and alcohol use. Urban residents and those living in specific regions experienced stronger associations, likely due to higher pollution levels and different environmental factors. Smokers and alcohol users were also more susceptible to the adverse effects of pollutants. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term exposure to multiple air pollutants increases the risk of GI diseases, while ozone may potentially offer some protective effects. Public health measures to reduce air pollution, especially in urban areas, and to protect high-risk groups are urgently needed.",27/06/2024,BMC public health
10.1111/wvn.70008,The Effectiveness of Mind-Body Exercise on Health-Related Quality of Life and Mental Health During and After Breast Cancer Treatment: An Umbrella Review of Meta-Analyses for Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Wen, Jingsi,Hui, Stanley Sai-Chuen,Chin, Edwin Chun-Yip,Yang, Yijian,Sit, Cindy Hui-Ping","BACKGROUND: Previous studies regarding mind-body exercise among people with breast cancer mostly focused on one type of mind-body exercise and provided conflicting results. AIMS: This paper aims to systematically synthesize the evidence hierarchy and examine the credibility of previous meta-analyses of different types of mind-body exercises. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Epitemonikos from database inception to February 2nd, 2024, for meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials. Included meta-analyses examined the effects of mind-body exercises on at least one outcome of health-related quality of life, cancer-related fatigue, depression, anxiety, and sleep quality in breast cancer patients. The random effects estimates (Hedges'G), 95% prediction interval, small study effect, and excess significance bias were calculated. Furthermore, we categorized meta-analyses based on the evidence credibility criteria and assessed quality using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2. RESULTS: The umbrella review included a re-analysis of 16 meta-analyses of 9 articles including 134 randomized controlled trials involving 9469 breast cancer patients and survivors. We identified 3 articles as ""low"" quality and 6 articles as ""critically low"" quality. Convincing evidence supported the effectiveness of Yoga intervention in reducing depression symptoms (G = -0.77, 95% Confidence Interval [-0.93, -0.61]). However, 11 meta-analyses were supported by weak evidence (1 for Qigong alleviated depression, 4 for Qigong, Baduanjin, Tai Chi Chuan, and Yoga improved health-related quality of life, 3 for multiple mind-body exercises, Tai Chi Chuan, and Yoga reduced cancer-related fatigue, 2 of Baduanjin and Yoga reduced anxiety, as well as 1 of Yoga improved sleep quality). LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Mind-body exercises, especially yoga, may be beneficial for improving health-related quality of life and mental health for breast cancer patients. Further high-quality interventions investigating diverse mind-body exercise interventions are warranted to ascertain the effectiveness of health-related quality of life and mental health outcomes.",01/12/2024,Worldviews on evidence-based nursing

However, such data do not distinguish which features of a predator encounter are encoded by VMHdm(SF1) neural activity. To address this issue, we imaged VMHdm(SF1) neurons at single-cell resolution in freely behaving mice exposed to a natural predator in varying contexts. Our results reveal that VMHdm(SF1) neurons do not encode different defensive behaviors but rather represent predator identity and multiple predator-evoked internal states, including threat-evoked fear/anxiety, arousal or neophobia, predator imminence, and safety. Notably, threat and safety are encoded bi-directionally by anti-correlated subpopulations. Strikingly, individual differences in predator defensiveness are correlated with individual differences in VMHdm(SF1) response dynamics. Thus, different threat-related internal state variables are encoded by distinct neuronal subpopulations within a genetically defined, anatomically restricted hypothalamic cell class.",25/06/2024,Neuron

However, further improvements are needed to refine outcomes in non-vaccine, extrahepatic applications, such as minimizing the mononuclear phagocyte system's (MPS)' rapid clearance and off-target toxicity in undesired tissues. We propose modifying LNP surfaces with the phagocytic cell ""don't eat me"" signal, CD47, in combination with our previously established antibody-based targeted LNP (tLNP) to create a CD47/tLNP platform with reduced phagocytic clearance and off-target effects, and improved efficiency for cell-specific delivery. We showed that CD47 modification decreased macrophage and hepatic uptake both in vitro and in vivo. Combining CD47 modification with antibodies targeting endothelial cells, T cells, or hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) increased targeting efficiency up to 3-fold compared to tLNP alone. Enhanced targeting of CD47/tLNP to HSCs with reduced off-targeting enabled the delivery of pro-apoptotic mRNA for HSC depletion as a preconditioning strategy prior to bone marrow transplant. Additionally, CD47-modified LNPs showed diminished inflammatory effects on hepatic tissue and an altered protein corona. Our CD47/tLNP-mRNA platform, with its reduced phagocytic clearance, mitigated inflammatory effects, and enhanced targeted delivery, should further facilitate the development of in vivo mRNA therapeutics.",08/07/2024,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy
,Cytogenetic analysis of recombination in males of Drosophila ananassae.,"Matsuda, M,Imai, H,Tobari, Y N","Cytogenetic studies of recombination in males of Drosophila ananassae were carried out by examining F1 males derived from he mating of marker females, b se; bri ru of the BS stock, with males of two wild strans, TNG and L8. The male recombination values in both sections b-se (chromosome 2) and bri-ru (chromosome 3) are high in TNG F1 but extremely low in L8 F1. We demonstrate the presence of chiasmata in TNG F1 males at a frequency capable of accounting for the observed recombination values. A unique series of ""iso-site aberrations"" was also observed in TNG F1 males. Because of a parallelism in the distribution pattern between the chiasmata and the iso-site aberrations, we propose that recombination in males of D. ananassae is meiotic in origin and that the iso-site aberrations are related to chiasma formation.",01/01/1983,Chromosoma

In this study of GPR52, an orphan GPCR with exceedingly high constitutive G-protein activity that is emerging as a neurotherapeutic target, we discovered its disproportionately low arrestin recruitment activity. After profiling the N-glycosylation and phosphorylation patterns, we found that these two types of PTMs differentially shape the intrinsic signaling bias of GPR52. While N-terminal N-glycosylation promotes constitutive G(s) signaling possibly through favoring the self-activating conformation, phosphorylation in helix 8, to our great surprise, suppresses arrestin recruitment and attenuates receptor internalization. In addition, we uncovered the counteracting roles of N-glycosylation and phosphorylation in modulating GPR52-dependent accumulation of the huntingtin protein in brain striatal cells. Our study provides new insights into the regulation of intrinsic signaling bias and cellular function of an orphan GPCR through distinct PTMs in different motifs.",29/05/2024,Nature chemical biology

Pirfenidone is an approved treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. It may attenuate ARDS-related fibrosis and decrease the need for prolonged ventilation. Accordingly, we aimed to evaluate the effect of pirfenidone on ventilator-free days in patients with ARDS. METHODS: In a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we plan to randomly assign 130 adults invasively ventilated for ARDS to receive pirfenidone or placebo for up to 28 days. The primary outcome is days alive and ventilator free at 28 days. Secondary outcomes include ICU-free days, hospital free days all at 28 day, ICU mortality and hospital mortality. We will also assess fibroproliferative changes on high-resolution CT scans at ICU discharge and quality of life. Data analysis will be on an intention-to-treat basis. DISCUSSION: The trial is ongoing and currently recruiting. It will be the first randomized controlled study to investigate whether, compared to placebo, pirfenidone reduces the number of days alive and ventilator-free in patients with ARDS. Its double-blind multicenter design will provide internal validity, minimal bias, and a degree of external validity. If our hypothesis is confirmed, this treatment would justify larger trials of this intervention.

While emerging AD therapeutics can slow cognitive decline, they may worsen dementia in certain groups of individuals. Therefore, alternative treatments are much needed. Microglia, the brain resident macrophages, have the potential to be novel therapeutic targets as they regulate many facets of AD, including lipid droplet (LD) accumulation, amyloid beta (Aβ) clearance, and neuroinflammation. To carry out such functions, microglia undergo phenotypic changes, which are linked to shifts in metabolism and substrate utilization. While homeostatic microglia are driven by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis, in aging and AD, microglia shift further towards glycolysis. Interestingly, this ""metabolic reprogramming"" may be linked to an increase in fructose metabolism. In the brain, microglia predominantly express the fructose transporter SLC2A5 (GLUT5), and enzymes involved in fructolysis and endogenous fructose production, with their expression being upregulated in aging and disease. Here, we review evidence for fructose uptake, breakdown, and production in microglia. We also evaluate emerging literature targeting fructose metabolism in the brain and periphery to assess its ability to modulate microglial function in AD. The ability of microglia to transport and utilize fructose, coupled with the well-established role of fructose in metabolic dysfunction, supports the notion that microglial fructose metabolism may be a novel potential therapeutic target for AD.",07/01/2025,Journal of neuroinflammation

However, response rates to monotherapy are poor in recurrent settings. Herein, we performed a retrospective analysis using real-world data to compare the outcomes of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab, carboplatin plus paclitaxel (PT), and doxorubicin for patients with PT-pretreated, advanced, or recurrent ECs. METHODS: We performed a multi-institutional retrospective analysis using de-identified electronic health record database (TriNetX) to compare lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab, carboplatin plus paclitaxel (PT), and doxorubicin outcomes in patients with PT-pretreated, advanced, or recurrent ECs. A 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted. The primary outcome was the overall survival (OS) among treatment groups. The secondary outcome was the adverse event profile. RESULTS: Between January 2012 and September 2023, we identified 397 patients with PT-treated, advanced, or recurrent ECs who received lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab, and 469 patients receiving PT at a platinum-free interval of over 6 months. Following PSM, no significant difference in median OS was observed between the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and re-challenge PT groups (19.1 vs. 18.5 months, p = 0.60; hazard ratio: 1.08, 95% confidence interval 0.81-1.46). However, lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab provided better survival benefits than doxorubicin. Adverse event analysis showed more hypothyroidism, hypertension, and proteinuria with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab, and more hematologic toxicities in both chemotherapy groups. CONCLUSIONS: Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab was not associated with improved survival when compared with re-challenge PT in patients with a platinum-free interval of over 6 months. Re-challenge PT remains a valid option for PT-treated, recurrent, or advanced ECs, especially in patients with a substantially long platinum-free interval.",08/05/2024,BMC medicine

This study found an elevated circRNA, circRUNX1, whiche promotes glycolysis and lactate generation, resulting in the infiltration of regulatory T cell (Treg) in NSCLC. circRUNX1 acts as a miR-145 sponge, inhibiting its negative regulation of the target gene HK2, therefore facilitating glycolysis and lactate generation.

The ability of the STOP model to predict no durable benefit (NDB; progressive disease, death within 6 months or disease control of less than 6 months) was assessed using specificity and positive predictive value (PPV). Moreover, a combination of the STOP model with RECIST after 6-8 weeks of ICIs was investigated.ResultsThe STOP model achieved a specificity of 96% (95% CI 95%-97%) and a PPV of predicting NDB of 88.1% (95% CI 85.9%-90.3%). Combining the STOP model with RECIST improved specificity and PPV to 100% and predicted NDB on average 11.6 weeks (IQR 1.8-18.0 weeks) prior to developing radiologically defined progression.ConclusionsAfter 6 weeks of ICIs, the blood-based STOP model was capable of accurately predicting NDB in metastatic NSCLC patients, earlier than conventional radiological assessment. The combined serological and radiological response assessment creates an early opportunity to safely stop ICI treatment in patients who will not benefit, although the clinical utility of the assay is limited since the high specificity comes at the cost of a lower sensitivity.",18/03/2025,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental        Biology and Medicine
10.1016/j.pan.2025.02.015,Recommendations from the European guidelines for the diagnosis and therapy of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.,"Vujasinovic, Miroslav,Iglesia, Daniel de la,Dominguez-Muñoz, J Enrique,Löhr, J Matthias","BACKGROUND: Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) is defined as a reduction in pancreatic exocrine secretion below a level that allows normal digestion of nutrients. Pancreatic disease and pancreatic surgery are the main causes of PEI, but other conditions can affect the digestive function of the pancreas. METHODS: In collaboration with European Digestive Surgery (EDS), European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN), European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN), European Society of Digestive Oncology (ESDO), and European Society of Primary Care Gastroenterology (ESPCG) the working group developed European guidelines for the diagnosis and therapy of PEI. United European Gastroenterology (UEG) provided both endorsement and financial support for the development of the guidelines. RESULTS: Recommendations covered topics related to the clinical management of PEI: concept, pathogenesis, clinical relevance, general diagnostic approach, general therapeutic approach, PEI secondary to chronic pancreatitis, PEI after acute pancreatitis, PEI associated with pancreatic cancer, PEI secondary to cystic fibrosis, PEI after pancreatic surgery, PEI after esophageal, gastric, and bariatric surgery, PEI in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and PEI in other conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The European guidelines for the diagnosis and therapy of PEI provide evidence-based recommendations concerning key aspects of the etiology, diagnosis, therapy, and follow-up, based on current available evidence. These recommendations should serve as a reference standard for existing management of PEI and as a guide for future clinical research.

10.7554/eLife.91329,Inhibiting NINJ1-dependent plasma membrane rupture protects against inflammasome-induced blood coagulation and inflammation.,"Cui, Jian,Li, Hua,Ye, Dien,Zhang, Guoying,Zhang, Yan,Yang, Ling,Sim, Martha M S,Wood, Jeremy P,Wei, Yinan,Li, Zhenyu,Wu, Congqing","Systemic blood coagulation accompanies inflammation during severe infections like sepsis and COVID. We previously established a link between coagulopathy and pyroptosis, a vital defense mechanism against infection. During pyroptosis, the formation of gasdermin-D (GSDMD) pores on the plasma membrane leads to the release of tissue factor (TF)-positive microvesicles (MVs) that are procoagulant. Mice lacking GSDMD release fewer of these procoagulant MVs. However, the specific mechanisms coupling the activation of GSDMD to MV release remain unclear. Plasma membrane rupture (PMR) in pyroptosis was recently reported to be actively mediated by the transmembrane protein Ninjurin-1 (NINJ1). Here, we show that NINJ1 promotes procoagulant MV release during pyroptosis. Haploinsufficiency or glycine inhibition of NINJ1 limited the release of procoagulant MVs and inflammatory cytokines, and partially protected against blood coagulation and lethality triggered by bacterial flagellin. Our findings suggest a crucial role for NINJ1-dependent PMR in inflammasome-induced blood coagulation and inflammation.",17/03/2025,eLife

We aimed to develop and validate a novel AI-based bedside tool that accurately predicts predict NOAF after CABG. METHODS: Data from 2994 patients who underwent CABG between March 2015 and July 2024 at two tertiary hospitals in China were retrospectively analyzed. 2486 patients from one hospital formed the derivation cohort, split 7:3 into training and test sets, while the 508 patients from a separate hospital formed the external validation cohort. A stacking model integrating 11 base learners was developed and evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score, and Area Under Curve (AUC). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were calculated and plotted to interpret the contributions of individual characteristics to the model's predictions. FINDINGS: Seventy-seven predictive characteristics were analyzed. The stacking model achieved superior performance with AUCs 0·931 and F1 scores 0·797 in the independent external validation, outperforming CHA2DS2-VASc, HATCH, and POAF scores (AUC 0·931 vs. 0·713, 0·708, and 0·667; p < 0·05). SHAP value indicate that the importance of predictive features for NOAF, in descending order, include: Brain natriuretic peptide, Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, Ejection fraction, BMI, β-receptor blockers, Duration of surgery, Age, Neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio, Myocardial infarction, Left atrial diameter, Hypertension, and smoking status. Subsequently, we constructed an easy-to-use bedside clinical tool for NOAF risk assessment leveraging these characteristics. INTERPRETATION: The AI-based tool offers superior prediction of NOAF, outperforming three existing predictive tools. Future studies should further explore how various patient characteristics influence the timing of NOAF onset, whether early or late.

Glioma stem cells (GSCs) drive GBM treatment resistance and recurrence, however, the molecular mechanisms activating intracranial GSCs remain unclear. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are crucial signaling mediators in regulating cell metabolism and can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This study aimed to elucidate how EV cargo contributes to the intracranial GSC state and validate a non-invasive diagnostic strategy for GBM relapse. Methods: We isolated plasma extracellular vesicles (pl-EVs) from three groups: recurrent GBM patients post-resection, non-recurrent GBM patients post-resection, and healthy individuals. Newly diagnosed GBM patients served as an additional control. EVs were characterized and co-cultured with primary GBM cell lines to assess their effect on tumor stemness. EV cargo was analyzed using proteomics to investigate specific EV subpopulations contributing to GBM relapse. Based on these findings, we generated engineered LDHA-enriched EVs (LDHA-EVs) and co-cultured them with patient-derived organoids (PDOs). Metabolomics was performed to elucidate the underlying signal transduction pathways. Results: Our study demonstrated that pl-EVs from recurrent GBM patients enhanced aerobic glycolysis and stemness in GBM cells. Proteomic analysis revealed that plasma EVs from recurrent GBMs encapsulated considerable amounts of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). Mechanistically, LDHA-loaded EVs promoted glycolysis, induced cAMP/ATP cycling, and accelerated lactate production, thereby maintained the GSC phenotype. Concurrently, post-surgical therapy-induced stress-modulated hypoxia in residual tumors, promoted LDHA-enriched EV release. Clinically, high levels of circulating LDHA-positive EVs correlated with increased glycolysis, poor therapeutic response, and shorter survival in recurrent GBM patients. Conclusion: Our study highlights LDHA-loaded EVs as key mediators promoting GSC properties and metabolic reprogramming in GBM. These findings provide insights into recurrence mechanisms and suggest potential liquid biopsy approaches for monitoring and preventing GBM relapse.",06/08/2024,Theranostics

In a comprehensive dataset of pediatric HGG (n = 261), we detect PDGFRA mutations and/or amplifications in 15% of cases, suggesting PDGFRA as a therapeutic target. We reveal that the PDGFRA/KIT inhibitor avapritinib shows (1) selectivity for PDGFRA inhibition, (2) distinct patterns of subcellular effects, (3) in vitro and in vivo activity in patient-derived HGG models, and (4) effective blood-brain barrier penetration in mice and humans. Furthermore, we report preliminary clinical real-world experience using avapritinib in pediatric and young adult patients with predominantly recurrent/refractory PDGFRA-altered HGG (n = 8). Our early data demonstrate that avapritinib is well tolerated and results in radiographic response in 3/7 cases, suggesting a potential role for avapritinib in the treatment of HGG with specific PDGFRA alterations.

However, there is still limited research on the role of F-box proteins in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). METHODS: Public databases were used to screen differentially expressed genes among 37 F-box proteins in clear cell RCC (ccRCC). The expression of the differential gene FBXO21 and its prognostic value were verified by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Pyrosequencing was used to detect the regulatory effect of DNA methylation on FBXO21 expression. The effects of FBXO21 expression on cell proliferation and metastasis were clarified through cell phenotype experiments and animal models. The relationship between FBXO21 expression and the infiltration levels of tumor immune cells was also analyzed. GSEA and Western blot were used to identify the downstream molecular pathways associated with FBXO21 expression. RESULTS: Our results revealed that FBXO21 was significantly underexpressed in ccRCC and that increased FBXO21 expression predicted a better patient prognosis. The promoter region of FBXO21 exhibited DNA hypermethylation, and FBXO21 expression was significantly restored after demethylation. In addition, FBXO21 overexpression significantly inhibited the proliferation and metastasis of ccRCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, FBXO21 expression was related to the stroma score and the infiltration levels of immune infiltrating cells associated with prognosis. Moreover, FBXO21 overexpression increased the expression of key molecules in the CREB pathway. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that FBXO21 is a novel prognostic biomarker for ccRCC patients and functions as a tumor suppressor gene. Moreover, FBXO21 may regulate the CREB pathway and is closely related to tumor immune cell infiltration in ccRCC.",04/11/2024,Journal of translational medicine

To overcome this limit, we develop a tailored, high-efficiency conversion system that increases the direct conversion of fibroblasts to motor neurons 100-fold. By tailoring the cocktail to a minimal set of transcripts, we reduce extrinsic variation, allowing us to examine how proliferation and TFs synergistically drive conversion. We show that cell state-as set by proliferation history-defines how cells interpret the levels of TFs. Controlling for proliferation history and titrating each TF, we find that conversion correlates with levels of the pioneer TF Ngn2. By isolating cells by both their proliferation history and Ngn2 levels, we demonstrate that levels of Ngn2 expression alone are insufficient to predict conversion rates. Rather, proliferation history and TF levels combine to drive direct conversion. Finally, increasing the proliferation rate of adult human fibroblasts generates morphologically mature induced human motor neurons at high rates.",28/12/2023,Cell systems

This study aimed to develop and validate a deep learning model using a novel voxel-level radiomics approach to predict pCR based on preoperative CT images. METHODS: In this multicenter, retrospective study, 741 patients with ESCC who underwent nICT followed by radical esophagectomy were enrolled from three institutions. Patients from one center were divided into a training set (469 patients) and an internal validation set (118 patients) while the data from the other two centers was used as external validation sets (120 and 34 patients, respectively). The deep learning model, Vision-Mamba, integrated voxel-level radiomics feature maps and CT images for pCR prediction. Additionally, other commonly used deep learning models, including 3D-ResNet and Vision Transformer, as well as traditional radiomics methods, were developed for comparison. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and prognostic stratification capabilities. The SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis was employed to interpret the model's predictions. RESULTS: The Vision-Mamba model demonstrated robust predictive performance in the training set (accuracy: 0.89, AUC: 0.91, sensitivity: 0.82, specificity: 0.92) and validation sets (accuracy: 0.83-0.91, AUC: 0.83-0.92, sensitivity: 0.73-0.94, specificity: 0.84-1.0). The model outperformed other deep learning models and traditional radiomics methods. The model's ability to stratify patients into high and low-risk groups was validated, showing superior prognostic stratification compared with traditional methods. SHAP provided quantitative and visual model interpretation. CONCLUSIONS: We present a voxel-level radiomics-based deep learning model to predict pCR to neoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy based on pretreatment diagnostic CT images with high accuracy and robustness.

However, the causal nature of this relationship is nevertheless largely unknown, due to unmeasured confounding factors from observational studies. We aimed to reveal the causal relationship between 28 circulating biochemistry markers and OA pathogenesis. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study between 28 circulating biomarkers and six OA types, using large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics data from a UK Biobank cohort (n = 450,243) and the latest OA meta-analysis (n = 826,690). We replicated the significant results of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol (TC) in an independent large GWAS dataset obtained from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC) (n > 800,000). RESULTS: Using 73 to 792 instrumental variables for biomarkers, this large MR analysis identified 11 causal associations at the Bonferroni corrected significance level of 2.98 × 10(-4), involving seven biomarkers and five OA types. LDL-C (odds ratio (OR) per SD increase 0.90, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.93), apolipoprotein B (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.91), TC (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.94), calcium (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.90), and glucose (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.89) are causally associated with a reduced risk of OA, while phosphate (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.30) and aspartate aminotransferase (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.24) are causally associated with an increased risk.

Diversified types of medications have been shown effective for alleviating SLE syndromes, ranging from cytokines, antibodies, hormones, molecular inhibitors or antagonists, to cell transfusion. Drugs developed for treating other diseases may benefit SLE patients, and agents established as SLE therapeutics may be SLE-inductive. Complexities regarding SLE therapeutics render it essential and urgent to identify the mechanisms-of-action and pivotal signaling axis driving SLE pathogenesis, and to establish innovative SLE-targeting approaches with desirable therapeutic outcome and safety. After introducing the research history of SLE and its epidemiology, we categorized primary determinants driving SLE pathogenesis by their mechanisms; combed through current knowledge on SLE diagnosis and grouped them by disease onset, activity and comorbidity; introduced the genetic, epigenetic, hormonal and environmental factors predisposing SLE; and comprehensively categorized preventive strategies and available SLE therapeutics according to their functioning mechanisms. In summary, we proposed three mechanisms with determinant roles on SLE initiation and progression, i.e., attenuating the immune system, restoring the cytokine microenvironment homeostasis, and rescuing the impaired debris clearance machinery; and provided updated insights on current understandings of SLE regarding its pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention and therapeutics, which may open an innovative avenue in the fields of SLE management.",04/09/2024,Signal transduction and targeted therapy

The regulatory role of tumor-associated macrophage-derived extracellular vesicles (TAM-EVs) in the immune microenvironment of CRLM has not yet been fully explored. Here, we found that TAM-EVs shaped the immunosuppressive microenvironment at the invasive front in murine CRLM models, thus dampening anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. This environment is characterized by an increased tumor stemness potential and abundant neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation. Mechanistically, TAM-EVs-derived fibrinogen-like 2 (FGL2) interacts with the FCGR2B receptor in tumor cells, which further activates a p-STAT3/IL-1β positive feedback loop to increase the stemness potential of cancer cells, whereas IL-1β mediates the communication between cancer cells and neutrophils. The use of an anti-IL-1β monoclonal antibody can reduce NETs production and synergize with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, which offers clinical translational significance for CRLM therapy. The FGL2/p-STAT3/IL-1β loop correlates with an immunosuppressive microenvironment and poor prognosis in human patients with CRLM. Our results revealed the potential of enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy via the targeted clearance of NETs using anti-IL-1β monoclonal antibodies, which have significant clinical translational value in the treatment of CRLM.",03/10/2024,Cancer letters

The current systematic review (SR) intends to provide complementary insights into the safety of anti-OA medications, using evidence from post-marketing safety surveillance studies. METHODS: The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO database (registration no. CRD42021227872). We followed the Cochrane methodology for SRs of interventions and comprehensively searched the Medline, CENTRAL, Scopus and TOXLINE databases from inception to November 2023, to include all post-marketing safety surveillance studies on any anti-OA medications. The outcomes of this SR were any adverse events (AEs) reported in the included studies. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 16,990 studies, of which 59 articles were ultimately included in the review. Most studies investigated non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, 27 studies, 28 reports) and intra-articular hyaluronic acid (IAHA, 16 studies). Symptomatic slow-acting drugs for osteoarthritis (SYSADOAs) were assessed in seven studies (one of which also assessed NSAIDs), and corticosteroid injections in four studies, while opioids and ""herbal mixtures and other compounds"" each were investigated respectively in three and two studies. Most of the studies were cohort studies (n = 44), others were case reports or case series (n = 12), RCTs (n = 2 reports of the same trial), or a case-control study (n = 1). The most commonly reported AEs with NSAIDs from cohort (sample sizes varied between 129 and 22,938 patients), RCT (21,645 patients with OA), and case-control (174 cases and 926 control patients with OA) studies were gastrointestinal (GI) and/or cardiovascular (CV) AEs, with specific AEs varying with individual NSAIDs. Where comparisons between NSAIDs were made, the overall literature shows a better or similar safety profile for celecoxib (at a daily dose of 200 mg, where dosage was reported) compared with other NSAIDs in regards to GI, CV and renal events. Other anti-OA medications with most common AEs reported from cohort studies were: IAHA (injection site pain); diacerein (GI AEs and reddish urine); avocado-soybean unsaponifiables (GI AEs); non-pharmaceutical-grade glucosamine and chondroitin (allergic reactions, GI disorders); opioids (hip fracture associated with long-term tramadol use among older adults; GI and nervous system disorders with hydrocodone); corticosteroid injections (increased risk of OA progression); herbal mixtures and other compounds (GI AEs). There were case reports or case series of specific AEs with various anti-OA medications that require further investigations in well-designed cohort studies before any definitive conclusions can be reached. CONCLUSIONS: This SR confirms previous evidence on the safety of anti-OA medications from meta-analyses of phase 3 RCTs. Beyond the evidence here reported, the limitations of this research highlight the urgent need of a reporting guideline for post-marketing safety surveillance studies. Importantly, real-life safety surveillance of anti-OA medications should be strengthened with large cohort studies with control groups, and results should be disaggregated by disease populations for drugs common to several conditions.",10/02/2025,Drugs

Acupuncture and its combined therapies may have beneficial effects on the endocrine and metabolic states of women with PCOS. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the treatment effects and potential mechanisms of acupuncture and its combined therapies compared to oral metformin in treating PCOS patients. METHODS: The evaluation focused on three sets of outcomes: hormonal indicators, metabolic indicators, and body weight indicators. Studies that involved additional therapies beyond the specified interventions or included patients with other diseases were excluded. Additionally, data mining methods were used, including frequency statistics to analyze the frequency of acupuncture points and the meridians involved, and the Apriori algorithm to perform association rule analysis for the most effective interventions. RESULTS: The study included 46 articles (51 studies) involving six interventions: acupuncture combined with metformin, acupuncture treatment, acupuncture with Chinese herbal medicine and metformin, acupuncture with Chinese herbal medicine, acupuncture combined with cupping, and auricular acupuncture combined with metformin showed significant improvements in all evaluated indicators. Data mining revealed the Stomach meridian of foot yangming was the most frequently used, and the most commonly used combination of points included CV4, SP6, and ST36. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that acupuncture and its combined therapies may benefit PCOS. However, risk of bias and heterogeneity observed were noted. Future high-quality, rigorously designed randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings and provide stronger clinical recommendations for acupuncture in PCOS treatment.",17/03/2025,Annals of medicine

10.1186/s12967-025-06301-z,Multidimensional bioinformatics perspective on smoking-linked driver genes and immune regulatory mechanisms in non-small cell lung cancer.,"Ouyang, Can,Yu, Xiaopeng,Wang, Huazhong,Zeng, Puhua","BACKGROUND: Lung cancer, one of the leading causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, is strongly associated with smoking as its primary carcinogenic factor. However, despite the strong link between smoking and lung cancer, not all smokers develop the disease, suggesting that individual genetic susceptibility and molecular mechanisms may play a critical role in the onset of lung cancer. Understanding the gene-driving mechanisms and immune regulatory pathways involved in smoking-related lung cancer remains one of the key challenges in current lung cancer research. METHODS: This study employs an integrative bioinformatics approach to explore gene expression differences and immune microenvironment characteristics between smokers with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and normal individuals. First, smoking-linked lung cancer driver genes (SLDCGs) were identified, followed by Mendelian Randomization (MR) and Summary-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) analyses to further validate their causal relationships. Next, public databases, including TCGA, GEO, and GTEx, were used to systematically analyze the expression differences of SLDCGs across various clinical subgroups, and immune infiltration analysis was conducted to explore their potential roles in the immune microenvironment of NSCLC. RESULTS: The study identified HLA-J and PRMT7 as core driver genes for smoking-associated NSCLC. MR analysis confirmed the potential causal relationship of HLA-J and PRMT7 in the development of NSCLC. Specifically, high expression of PRMT7 was closely associated with the occurrence of NSCLC, while low expression of HLA-J was implicated in immune evasion mechanisms in NSCLC. Additionally, immune microenvironment analysis revealed that HLA-J enhances the activity of immune cells, particularly T cells, to promote tumor immune recognition, whereas PRMT7 suppresses immune cell function, weakening immune surveillance and facilitating immune evasion. CONCLUSION: This study systematically reveals the molecular mechanisms of smoking-linked NSCLC through multidimensional bioinformatics analysis, highlighting the key roles of SLDCGs in immune evasion. The discovery of HLA-J and PRMT7 provides new theoretical foundations for targeted immunotherapy, with significant potential for early diagnosis and personalized treatment of smoking-induced NSCLC. Future research should focus on validating these genes in clinical samples and exploring their potential in immunotherapy.",23/12/2024,Journal of translational medicine
10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.105646,VIPAS39 confers ferroptosis resistance in epithelial ovarian cancer through exporting ACSL4.,"Jiang, Yuening,Li, Jie,Wang, Tianzhen,Gu, Xiaoyang,Li, Xinyu,Liu, Zhaofei,Yue, Wei,Li, Mo","BACKGROUND: The high mortality rate associated with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is primarily due to recurrence and chemoresistance, underscoring the urgent need for innovative therapeutic approaches that leverage newly identified vulnerabilities in cancer cells. While conventional chemotherapies induce apoptosis by targeting DNA or mitotic machinery, ferroptosis represents a new distinct form of programmed cell death characterised by the accumulation of lipid peroxides. METHODS: The sensitivity of different EOC cell lines to ferroptosis inducers was evaluated using cell viability assays and lipid peroxidation measurements. Live-cell imaging with the pH-sensitive CD63-pHuji reporter was performed to track the extracellular export of acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) via exosomes. The upstream regulator of ACSL4 were identified through immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) and validated using protein binding assays. Finally, cell-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were utilised to evaluate the therapeutic potential overcoming ferroptosis resistance. FINDINGS: In this study, we found that interferon (IFN)-γ combined with arachidonic acid (AA), which are endogenous ferroptosis inducers, could initiate ferroptosis in most EOC cells. However, some EOC cells displayed significant resistance. Contrary to the typical increase in ACSL4 protein observed in ferroptosis-sensitive cells, resistant EOC cells exhibited surprisingly low levels of this pro-ferroptotic lipid metabolic protein. Intriguingly, this reduction is attributed to the exosomal expulsion of ACSL4 protein, revealing a distinct cellular mechanism to evade ferroptosis. We further identified VIPAS39 as a pivotal regulator in sorting ACSL4 into late endosomes, thereby facilitating their subsequent release as exosomes. Notably, targeting VIPAS39 not only overcomes the resistance to ferroptotic cell death but also markedly suppresses tumour growth. INTERPRETATION: Our findings uncover the crucial role of VIPAS39 in ferroptosis evasion by facilitating the exporting of ACSL4 protein via exosomes, highlighting VIPAS39 as a promising target for ferroptosis-based anti-cancer therapy.

This rare focal liver disease affects all races and ages, with a predominance of young males. There is an up to 88% association with inflammatory bowel disease. Although the aetiology is unknown and the pathophysiology is poorly understood, PSC is regarded as an autoimmune liver disease based on a strong immunogenetic background. Further, the associated risk for various malignancies, particularly cholangiocellular carcinoma, is also poorly understood. No medical therapy has been approved so far nor has been shown to improve transplant-free survival. However, ursodeoxycholic acid is widely used since it improves the biochemical parameters of cholestasis and is safe at low doses. MRI of the biliary tract is the primary imaging technology for diagnosis. Endoscopic interventions of the bile ducts should be limited to clinically relevant strictures for balloon dilatation, biopsy and brush cytology. End-stage liver disease with decompensation is an indication for liver transplantation with recurrent PSC in up to 38% of patients. Several novel therapeutic strategies are in various stages of development, including apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter and ileal bile acid transporter inhibitors, integrin inhibitors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists, CCL24 blockers, recombinant FGF19, CCR2/CCR5 inhibitors, farnesoid X receptor bile acid receptor agonists, and nor-ursodeoxycholic acid.

10.1681/ASN.0000000681,Deficiency of GADD45α-R-Loop Pathway and Kidney Injury in Diabetic Nephropathy.,"Li, Xue Qi,Zhang, Jia Xiu,Li, Liang,Wu, Qin Yi,Ruan, Xiong Zhong,Chen, Pei Pei,Ma, Kun Ling","BACKGROUND: Diabetic nephropathy is a primary cause of kidney failure. Persistent hyperglycemia causes metabolic perturbations epigenetically dysregulating gene expression in renal cells, thereby leading to diabetic nephropathy pathogenesis. On analyzing the GEO database by using machine learning algorithms, our preliminary results demonstrated that growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45α (GADD45α) might serve as key regulators in diabetic nephropathy. Furthermore, emerging evidence has shown that R-loops, the three-stranded DNA-RNA structures, are crucial to gene expression during diabetic nephropathy. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the role of GADD45α in diabetic nephropathy by modulating epigenetic alterations through interaction with R-loops. METHODS: A diabetic mouse model was established by injecting streptozotocin intraperitoneally into mice. Kidney histology and biochemical markers were analyzed in wild-type, GADD45α knockout, and renal tubule-specific GADD45α-overexpressing mice. The GADD45α lentivirus was used to induce the overexpression of GADD45α in HK-2 cells, while high-glucose treatment was applied to verify the mechanisms in vitro. RESULTS: GADD45α expression was reduced in kidneys of diabetic nephropathy, correlating with kidney dysfunction. GADD45α knockout worsened kidney injuries, while overexpression mitigated them. Mechanistically, GADD45α interacted with R-loops on the STEAP4 promoter, recruiting TET1 to activate STEAP4 transcription. Deficiency in the GADD45α-R-loop pathway exacerbated mitochondrial injury, disrupted lipid metabolism, and increased oxidative stress in diabetic nephropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Deficiency of GADD45α exacerbates diabetic nephropathy by interacting with R-loops and inhibiting STEAP4 promoter demethylation. Targeting the GADD45α-R-loop pathway offers therapeutic potential against diabetic nephropathy.",09/10/2024,Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN

OBJECTIVE: To compare the associations of NCIT and NCRT with tumor regression and long-term survival in patients with locally advanced ESCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this comparative effectiveness research study, from January 2016 to March 2023, patients with locally advanced ESCC who underwent esophagectomy following NCRT or NCIT were identified from a prospective database of 8 high-volume esophageal surgery centers in China. Follow-up began on the date of surgery and continued until the last recorded contact or March 2024, whichever occurred first. Data were analyzed between April and September 2024. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end points were 2-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Secondary end points included major pathologic response (MPR) and pathologic complete response (pCR). Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to investigate the risk factors for OS and DFS. RESULTS: The study included 1428 patients (median [IQR] age, 63 [57-68] years; 1184 men [82.9%]), with 704 patients in the NCRT group and 724 patients in the NCIT group. After propensity score matching, there were 532 patients in each group. The 2-year OS (81.3% vs 71.3%; hazard ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.26-1.96; P < .001) and DFS (73.9% vs 63.4%; hazard ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.11-1.69; P < .001) rates were significantly higher in NCIT group than in the NCRT group. The NCRT group had a higher MPR rate than that of the NCIT group (71.8% vs 61.5%), whereas the pCR rates were similar (25.9% vs 22.9%). Multivariable Cox analysis demonstrated that NCIT and MPR were independently associated with both OS and DFS. The NCIT group exhibited a lower overall recurrence rate (126 patients [23.7%] vs 190 patients [35.7%]) and distant metastasis rate (72 patients [13.5%] vs 133 patients [25.0%]), although locoregional metastasis rates were similar (98 patients [18.4%] vs 111 patients [20.9%]). Better OS and DFS were obtained for the NCIT group than for the NCRT group, regardless of whether adjuvant immunotherapy was given. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Compared with NCRT, patients with locally advanced ESCC receiving NCIT had better 2-year OS and DFS. The decrease in distant metastasis may be the main reason, but further prospective randomized clinical trials are needed to verify this finding.",19/03/2025,JAMA surgery

Lipolysis was determined by glycerol turnover ([2H5]-glycerol infusion) and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) phosphorylation (Western blot) from SAT samples biopsied prior to and 30-minutes following insulin infusion during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (HEC).RESULTSGlycerol turnover suppression during the HEC (first step) was lower in participants with IR compared with those with IS. Prior to insulin infusion, activated ATGL (reflected by the p-ATGL (Ser406)-to-ATGL ratio) was greater in participants with IR compared with those with IS and suppressed in response to a 30-minute insulin exposure in participants with IS, but not in those with IR. Lastly, greater ATGL inactivation is associated with greater glycerol suppression and lower liver fat.CONCLUSIONSInsulin-mediated inhibition of adipose tissue lipolysis via ATGL is dysregulated among adolescents with IR compared with those with IS, thereby serving as a vital mechanism linking glucose and insulin dysregulation and ectopic lipid storage within the liver.FUNDINGThis work was supported by funding from the NIH (R01-HD028016-25A1, T32- DK-007058, R01-DK124272, RO1-DK119968, R01MD015974, RO1-DK113984, P3-DK045735, RO1-DK133143, and RC2-DK120534) and the Robert E.

While probiotics show potential to enhance microbiota resilience, their role in optimizing donor microbiota for FMT remains underexplored. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated whether pretreatment of donor microbiota with L. plantarum GR-4 could improve FMT outcomes in a DSS-induced colitis model by modulating microbial stability, metabolic activity, and host-microbiome interactions. METHODS: Donor mice received L. plantarum GR-4 for 3 weeks to generate modified FMT (MFMT). DSS-colitis mice were treated with MFMT, conventional FMT, or 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). Multi-omics analyses and functional assays (stress resistance, engraftment efficiency) were used to evaluate therapeutic mechanisms. RESULTS: GR-4 pretreatment conferred three key advantages to donor microbiota: Ecological stabilization: 1. GR-4-driven acidification (pH 3.97 vs. 4.59 for LGG, p < 0.0001) enriched butyrogenic Butyricicoccus (73 % butyrate increase, p < 0.05) and improved stress resistance to bile acids/gastric conditions (1.25 × survival vs. FMT). 2. Metabolic reprogramming: GR-4 metabolized 25.3 % of tryptophan (vs. 10.3 % for LGG) to generate immunomodulatory indoles (ILA, IAA), activating aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling and upregulating anti-inflammatory IL-10/IL-22. 3. Bile acid remodeling: MFMT restored sulfolithocholic acid and β-MCA levels, outperforming FMT in resolving DSS-induced dysregulation. MFMT achieved an 83 % remission rate (vs. 50 % for FMT), enhanced gut barrier integrity, and reversed colitis-associated metabolic dysregulation (e.g., elevated spermidine, 7-sulfocholic acid). Probiotic preconditioning improved donor engraftment by 1.25 × and enriched success-associated taxa (Sporobacter, Butyricimonas), while suppressing pathogens (Clostridium papyrosolvens). CONCLUSIONS: L. plantarum GR-4 optimizes donor microbiota via pH-driven niche engineering, immunometabolic reprogramming, and bile acid modulation, addressing key limitations of conventional FMT. The multi-targeted efficacy of MFMT, evidenced by superior remission rates and metabolic restoration, establishes this approach as a translatable strategy for IBD therapy. This study establishes probiotic-enhanced FMT as a paradigm for precision microbiome interventions.",16/12/2024,Journal of advanced research

Probiotics show potential as an adjuvant treatment for URTIs, but evidence in children is limited. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a probiotic mixture containing Bifidobacterium breve M-16V, Bifidobacterium lactis HN019, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 in shortening fever duration among children with URTIs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted between November 19, 2021, and June 20, 2023, at the pediatric emergency department of the Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico in Milan, Italy. Patients between 28 days and 4 years of age with a fever (≥38.5 °C) and URTI were eligible. Exclusion criteria included recent probiotic use, chronic autoimmune diseases, immunosuppressive treatment, and requirement for hospitalization. Randomization was computer generated and assigned participants to either the intervention (probiotics) or control (placebo) group. Participants, parents or caregivers, and investigators were masked to the group assignments. The primary analysis followed the intention-to-treat approach. INTERVENTIONS: The probiotic group received daily single dose of 0.5 mL probiotic mixture containing Bifidobacterium breve M-16V, Bifidobacterium lactis HN019, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 for 14 days. The placebo group received daily single dose of 0.5 mL placebo for 14 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was fever duration, defined as the number of days between the first and the last days with fever. RESULTS: Of the 128 patients enrolled (69 males [54%]; mean [SD] age 2.5 [1.3] years), 65 (51%) were randomly assigned to receive placebo and 63 (49%) to receive probiotics. The median (IQR) fever duration was shorter in the probiotic group than the placebo group (median [IQR], 3 [2-4] days vs 5 [4-6] days; adjusted risk ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51-0.80). Few mild adverse events were reported and did not significantly differ between the probiotic and placebo groups, including constipation (6 [16%] and 6 [12%]; P = .80) and abdominal pain (3 [8%] and 2 [4%]; P = .65). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, administering a probiotic mixture reduced fever duration by 2 days compared with placebo, with no meaningful safety concerns.

METHODS: Prior to hysterectomy for EC or benign indications, women collected vaginal pool samples with intravaginal tampons and underwent endometrial brushing. Specimens underwent pyrosequencing for DNA methylation of genes reported to be hypermethylated in gynecologic cancers and recently identified markers discovered by profiling over 200 ECs. Methylation was evaluated individually across CpGs and averaged across genes. Differences between EC and benign endometrium (BE) were assessed using two-sample t-tests and area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: Thirty-eight ECs and 28 BEs were included. We evaluated 97 CpGs within 12 genes, including previously reported markers (RASSF1, HSP2A, HOXA9, CDH13, HAAO, and GTF2A1) and those identified in discovery work (ASCL2, HTR1B, NPY, HS3ST2, MME, ADCYAP1, and additional CDH13 CpG sites). Mean methylation was higher in tampon specimens from EC v. BE for 9 of 12 genes (ADCYAP1, ASCL2, CDH13, HS3ST2, HTR1B, MME, HAAO, HOXA9, and RASSF1) (all p<0.05). Among these genes, relative hypermethylation was observed in EC v. BE across CpGs. Endometrial brush and tampon results were similar. Within tampon specimens, AUC was highest for HTR1B (0.82), RASSF1 (0.75), and HOXA9 (0.74). This is the first report of HOXA9 hypermethylation in EC.

Both EBV and Plasmodium falciparum malaria are cofactors in the etiology of BL. However, how these 2 pathogens drive BL pathogenesis is not yet understood. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that P. falciparum and EBV synergize to induce dysregulated expression of AID. Using flow cytometry, intracellular AID expression was measured in PBMCs from a cohort of children from Western Kenya with uncomplicated malaria and community controls. Children with uncomplicated malaria had elevated levels of CD19+ AID+ B cells compared to controls. This high level of AID was sustained up to 8 weeks after parasite clearance. Using ImageStream flow cytometry, we found that 52% of AID was localized in the nucleus of CD19+ B cells in children with malaria. To test whether EBV and P. falciparum synergized to drive the expression of AID, we stimulated CD19+ B cells with EBV, CpG (to mimic P. falciparum DNA), or BAFF (induced during P. falciparum infection), or as a combination. Individually, EBV, BAFF and CpG induced AID expression. However, when combined, there was a significant increase of ∼30% in the frequency of CD19+AID+ cells above cells treated with EBV, BAFF, or CpG individually. Collectively, these data suggest that P. falciparum malaria and EBV coinfection result in sustained AID expression, potentially influencing the MYC translocation that is characteristic of BL.",26/08/2024,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)"
10.1136/bmjebm-2024-112974,Analgesic effects of non-surgical and non-interventional treatments for low back pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomised trials.,"Cashin, Aidan G,Furlong, Bradley M,Kamper, Steven J,De Carvalho, Diana,Machado, Luciana Ac,Davidson, Simon Re,Bursey, Krystal K,Abdel Shaheed, Christina,Hall, Amanda M","OBJECTIVES: To investigate the efficacy of non-surgical and non-interventional treatments for adults with low back pain compared with placebo. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials evaluating non-surgical and non-interventional treatments compared with placebo or sham in adults (≥18 years) reporting non-specific low back pain. INFORMATION SOURCES: MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsychInfo and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from inception to 14 April 2023. RISK OF BIAS: Risk of bias of included studies was assessed using the 0 to 10 PEDro Scale. SYNTHESIS OF RESULTS: Random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled effects and corresponding 95% confidence intervals on outcome pain intensity (0 to 100 scale) at first assessment post-treatment for each treatment type and by duration of low back pain-(sub)acute (<12 weeks) and chronic (≥12 weeks). Certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment (GRADE) approach. RESULTS: A total of 301 trials (377 comparisons) provided data on 56 different treatments or treatment combinations. One treatment for acute low back pain (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)), and five treatments for chronic low back pain (exercise, spinal manipulative therapy, taping, antidepressants, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) agonists) were efficacious; effect sizes were small and of moderate certainty. Three treatments for acute low back pain (exercise, glucocorticoid injections, paracetamol), and two treatments for chronic low back pain (antibiotics, anaesthetics) were not efficacious and are unlikely to be suitable treatment options; moderate certainty evidence. Evidence is inconclusive for remaining treatments due to small samples, imprecision, or low and very low certainty evidence. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence shows that one in 10 non-surgical and non-interventional treatments for low back pain are efficacious, providing only small analgesic effects beyond placebo. The efficacy for the majority of treatments is uncertain due to the limited number of randomised participants and poor study quality. Further high-quality, placebo-controlled trials are warranted to address the remaining uncertainty in treatment efficacy along with greater consideration for placebo-control design of non-surgical and non-interventional treatments.

Effective dietary strategies for early prevention are controversial. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether an individualized nutritional intervention reduced GDM incidence in high-risk females. METHODS: A randomized trial was conducted at three tertiary hospitals in Shanghai, China. We randomly assigned (1:1) pregnant women in the first trimester who were identified to be at high risk of GDM by a prediction model to either an individualized nutritional intervention or usual care. The intervention consisted of three dietary consultations by dietitians based on Chinese dietary guidelines before the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 24-28 gestational weeks. The control group received usual care. All participants provided 3-day food records at each follow-up. The primary outcome was GDM incidence using the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group criteria. Key secondary outcomes were dietary alterations, gestational weight gain (GWG), maternal metabolic profile, perinatal and pregnancy outcomes. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 519 females were enrolled, of whom 261 were assigned to the intervention and 258 to usual care. GDM was diagnosed in 85/245 (34.7%) females in the intervention group compared to 89/244 (36.5%) in the control group (adjusted relative risk 0.91 [95% CI: 0.73, 1.15], p=0.44]. More females in the intervention group had an appropriate GWG than the control group (1.38 [1.06, 1.79]) and lower levels of fasting and 2-hour insulin during the OGTT (p<.001). We observed a reduction in the rate of small for gestational age in the intervention group compared with the control group (0.11 [0.01, 0.80]) and neonatal hypoglycemia (0.14 [0.04, 0.57]). CONCLUSIONS: Among females at risk of GDM, an individualized nutritional intervention based on Chinese dietary guidelines provided before the OGTT did not prevent GDM but helped to manage GWG appropriately and improved pregnancy outcomes.

10.1002/ajh.27666,"Waldenström Macroglobulinemia: 2025 Update on Diagnosis, Risk Stratification, and Management.","Gertz, Morie A","DISEASE OVERVIEW: Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) is a lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma with immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal protein. Clinical features include anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and rarely hyperviscosity. DIAGNOSIS: The presence of IgM monoclonal protein associated with ≥ 10% clonal lymphoplasmacytic cells in bone marrow confirms the diagnosis. The L265P mutation in MYD88 is detectable in more than 90% of patients and is found in most IgM MGUS patients. MYD88 is not required for the diagnosis. RISK STRATIFICATION: Age, albumin, hemoglobin level, platelet count, β(2) microglobulin, Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and monoclonal IgM concentrations are characteristics that are predictive of outcomes. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: Not all patients who fulfill WM criteria require therapy; these patients can be observed until symptoms develop. Rituximab-monotherapy is inferior to combination regimens. Recommended first-line therapy can be chemoimmunotherapy or a covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The preferred Mayo Clinic induction is either rituximab and bendamustine (without rituximab maintenance) or zanubrutinib. MANAGEMENT OF REFRACTORY DISEASE: Bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, thalidomide, everolimus, pirtobrutinib, carfilzomib, lenalidomide, bendamustine, and venetoclax have all been shown to have activity in relapsed WM. Given WM's natural history, the reduction of therapy toxicity is an important part of treatment selection. Most patients succumb to causes unrelated to macroglobulinemia.",26/02/2025,American journal of hematology
10.1172/JCI190957,Macrophages: key conductors behind perivascular inflammation and vascular remodeling in hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension.,"Spiekerkoetter, Edda","Pulmonary hypertension (PH) encompasses a heterogenous group of disorders with the common feature of increased pulmonary arterial pressures. Patients with PH associated with lung disease and/or hypoxia undergo immune-mediated vascular remodeling that includes thickening of the muscular layer surrounding arteries and arterioles. In this issue of the JCI, Kumar and colleagues examined the role of interstitial macrophages in a model of high-altitude PH. Resident interstitial macrophages increased, proliferated, and expressed CCL2, a monocyte chemoattractant ligand. There was also a rise in CCR2+ macrophages expressing thrombospondin-1, which is known to activate vascular remodeling through TGF-β. Blocking monocyte recruitment partially reduced hypoxic PH, and corticosteroid treatment effectively reduced CCL2 expression and CCR2+ monocyte recruitment. Further, plasma samples collected from individuals ascending from low to high altitudes showed increased thrombospondin-1 and TGF-β levels, which were reduced with dexamethasone. These findings reveal interstitial macrophage populations as potential therapeutic targets in hypoxic PH.",17/03/2025,The Journal of clinical investigation

This analysis aimed to describe the outcomes at 12 and 24 weeks after starting cenobamate therapy in a real-world setting. METHODS: BLESS [NCT05859854] is an ongoing, observational, retrospective and prospective cohort study to evaluate the real-world effectiveness and safety of adjunctive cenobamate in adults with uncontrolled focal epilepsy. Subgroup analysis was performed in subjects with 2 to 3 previous ASMs (early users) and those with >3 previous ASMs (late users). RESULTS: The second interim analysis of the BLESS study included 388 participants with a median (interquartile range) age of 43.0 (31.0-54.0) years. They had a median of 6.0 (4.0-9.0) prior ASMs and a median of 7.2 (3.0-20.6) monthly seizures at baseline. The median monthly seizure frequency was reduced by 59.9% (19.2%-87.3%) from baseline to 24 weeks; 229 (59.0%) subjects had a ≥50% seizure frequency reduction, and 44 (11.3%) showed sustained seizure freedom. The proportion of participants taking ≤2 concomitant ASMs increased from 217 (56.5%) at baseline to 239 (65.7%) at 24 weeks. Among the early users (n = 76, 19.6%), the median reduction in monthly seizure frequency at 24 weeks was 78.0% (50.0-97.1%), and 76.3% of subjects had a ≥50% response rate. The frequency of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) was 5.3% and 23.4% in early and late users. The most frequent ADRs were somnolence, dizziness, and balance disorder; after the occurrence of ADRs, 63.5% of participants maintained the prescribed dose, and 5.2% permanently discontinued treatment. SIGNIFICANCE: Cenobamate was effective in reducing seizure frequency in a real-world setting and showed a manageable safety profile. The treatment with cenobamate also reduced the burden of concomitant ASMs in both early and late users.",13/02/2025,Epilepsia

While contemporary data-driven approaches have led to the discovery of self-assembling peptides with various structures and properties, predicting the functionalities of these materials is still challenging. Here we describe the deep learning-guided de novo design of antimicrobial materials based on self-assembling peptides targeting bacterial membranes to address the emerging problem of bacterial drug resistance. Our approach integrates non-natural amino acids for enhanced peptide self-assembly and effectively predicts the functional activity of the self-assembling peptide materials with minimal experimental annotation. The designed self-assembling peptide leader displays excellent in vivo therapeutic efficacy against intestinal bacterial infection in mice. Moreover, it exhibits an enhanced biofilm eradication capability and does not induce acquired drug resistance. Mechanistic studies reveal that the designed peptide can self-assemble on bacterial membranes to form nanofibrous structures for killing multidrug-resistant bacteria. This work thus provides a strategy to discover functional peptide materials by customized design.",11/04/2024,Nature materials

ADAMTS13 containing product including fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and plasma-derived Factor VIII concentrates are commonly used to supply ADAMTS13; however, frequent hospital visits and allergic reactions are major drawbacks. A recombinant ADAMTS13 (rADAMTS13) was recently developed to address these issues. However, real-world evidence has not been reported owing to the rarity of this condition. This study compared the efficacy and safety of FFP and rADAMTS13 in 14 Japanese patients, including five patients with end-stage renal disease who were excluded from the phase III trial. The median peak level of ADAMTS13 activity 15 min after rADAMTS13 administration was significantly higher than that after FFP (68.4% vs. 15.9%, p<0.001). ADAMTS13 activity 1 week after rADAMTS13 administration was well maintained compared with FFP infusion (11.6% vs. 5.1%, p<0.001). Patients reported no allergic reactions after rADAMTS13 administration and appreciated the convenience of a single infusion of rADAMTS13, suggesting that rADAMTS13 is a safe and effective alternative to FFP in patients with cTTP.

OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of PFA and thermal ablation in patients with HCM and AF. METHODS: From 2016 to 2024, patients with HCM undergoing a first AF ablation using PFA or thermal ablation (cryoballoon or radiofrequency) were retrospectively included from 3 French and Swiss centers. Freedom from atrial arrhythmia (AA) recurrence at the 12-month follow-up was assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 109 patients (median age 60 years; 68% male; 43% paroxysmal AF) with HCM underwent PFA (n = 58) or thermal ablation (n = 51) of AF. In addition to pulmonary vein (PV) isolation, extra-PV ablation was performed in 62% of PFA cases and in 18% of thermal cases. PFA was associated with shorter median procedure times than thermal ablation (81 minutes [Q1-Q3: 60-110 minutes] vs 132 minutes [Q1-Q3: 75-190 minutes]; P < 0.0001) and with less postprocedural heart failure (n = 0 vs n = 4; P = 0.03). Freedom from AA recurrence was 57% (95% CI: 46%-67%) after 12 months. PFA was associated with less AA recurrence than thermal ablation (adjusted HR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.23-0.91; P = 0.03). Extra-PV ablation was associated with more sustained AA recurrence with thermal ablation (HR: 3.07; 95% CI: 1.21-7.82; P = 0.02) but not with PFA (HR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.35-3.27; P = 0.91).

The recruitment of RTEL1 to telomeres occurs during the S-phase of the cell cycle, but the dynamics of the process has not been studied. Here, we utilized CRISPR genome editing and single-molecule imaging to monitor RTEL1 movement within human cell nuclei. RTEL1 utilizes rapid three-dimensional diffusion to search for telomeres and other nuclear targets. Only 5% of the chromatin-bound RTEL1 is associated with telomeres at any time in the S-phase, but the telomere-bound RTEL1 has much more extended associations. This binding is enhanced by the interaction between RTEL1 and the telomeric protein TRF2 but is largely independent of RTEL1 ATPase activity. The absence of RTEL1 catalytic activity leads to severe defects in cell proliferation, slow progression out of S-phase, and chromosome end-to-end fusion events. We propose that the rapid diffusion of RTEL1 allows this low-abundance protein to explore the nucleus, bind TRF2, and be recruited to telomeres.",21/02/2025,Nucleic acids research

Although niraparib can effectively affect its progression, the challenge of drug resistance remains. Herein, niraparib-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines were constructed to identify the abnormally activated enhancers and associated target genes via RNA in situ conformation sequencing. Notably, the target gene RAD23A was markedly upregulated in niraparib-resistant cells, and inhibiting RAD23A restored their sensitivity. Additionally, abnormal activation of glycolysis in niraparib-resistant cells induced lactate accumulation, which promoted the lactylation of histone H4K12 lysine residues. Correlation analysis showed that key glycolysis enzymes such as pyruvate kinase M and lactate dehydrogenase A were significantly positively correlated with RAD23A expression in ovarian cancer. Additionally, H4K12la activated the super-enhancer (SE) of niraparib and RAD23A expression via MYC transcription factor, thereby enhancing the DNA damage repair ability and promoting the drug resistance of ovarian cancer cells. Overall, the findings of this study indicate that lactic acid accumulation leads to lactylation of histone H4K12la, thereby upregulating SE-mediated abnormal RAD23A expression and promoting niraparib resistance in ovarian cancer cells, suggesting RAD23A as a potential therapeutic target for niraparib-resistant ovarian cancer.",24/09/2024,Molecular cancer

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between vitamin C, D, and K intake and IBD risk. METHODS: This study included 3,591 participants from the 2009-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Multivariable logistic regression were conducted to assess associations between vitamin C, D, and K intake and IBD risk while controlling for multiple confounders. Subgroup analyses were employed to test the robustness of the associations across participants with various characteristics. Additionally, restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was conducted to investigate potential nonlinear relationships. RESULTS: In the fully adjusted model, each 1 mcg increase in vitamin D intake was linked to an approximately 51% decrease in IBD risk (adjusted OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.25-0.98, p = 0.045). The benefit appeared stronger in women, individuals without hypertension, and non-smokers. No statistically significant associations were found between vitamin C or vitamin K intake and IBD risk. However, among individuals without diabetes, each 1 mcg increase in vitamin K intake was associated with an approximate 67% reduction in IBD risk (adjusted OR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.12-0.94, p = 0.039). RCS analysis suggested a linear relationship between dietary micronutrient intake and IBD risk (vitamin D: p for nonlinearity = 0.127, p for overall = 0.015; vitamin C: p for nonlinearity = 0.984, p for overall = 0.937; vitamin K: p for nonlinearity = 0.736, p for overall = 0.434). CONCLUSION: Increased vitamin D intake may reduce the risk of IBD, with more pronounced benefits in certain subgroups, highlighting the potential of vitamin D supplementation as a novel therapeutic approach for IBD prevention and management. Future well-designed studies should further test the therapeutic effects of vitamin D supplementation and investigate the associations of other dietary trace elements with IBD risk to better inform prevention and treatment approaches.",30/11/2024,BMC gastroenterology

However, establishing a causal relationship and quantifying the resultant global health impact remain challenging. METHODS: A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted using summary-level data obtained from the IEU database. Multiple MR approaches, including inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger regression, weighted median, weighted mode, and simple mode methods, were implemented to ensure robust causal inference. In parallel, Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2021 were analyzed to determine the trends in mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in T2DKD attributable to high BMI (HBMI-T2DKD) from 1990 to 2021. Joinpoint regression was used to estimate the average annual percent change (AAPC). Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) models were then applied to project the disease burden through 2049. RESULTS: MR analyses provided strong evidence for a causal relationship between elevated BMI and T2DKD. The GBD analysis revealed a sustained global increase in HBMI-T2DKD burden over the past three decades. Between 1990 and 2021, the result of AAPC indicated a persistent upward trend. The burden was particularly high among older adults, with the highest impact observed in East Asia and middle Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) region.

However, the prognostic significance of overt HE post-TIPS remains controversial. METHODS: We screened 2137 patients who underwent TIPS insertion at eight German tertiary care centers between 2004 and 2021. Patients with pre-emptive TIPS placement, hepatocellular carcinoma, missing data, and non-PTFE covered stents were excluded. Competing risk analysis was performed, considering liver transplantation as a competing event. To correct for immortal time bias, landmark analyses were conducted, with the landmark being set at 30 and 90-days post-TIPS. Outcome data were assessed for up to 30 months post-TIPS insertion. RESULTS: A total of 1356 patients (median MELD: 13 (IQR 10-17), age: 60 (IQR 54-67), 64% male, 12% HE before TIPS), were included. Overall, HE post-TIPS was linked to impaired survival (p<0.001, sHR: 1.41 [1.15-1.73]). However, this was only confirmed if HE occurred within the first 30 days post-TIPS (early HE; p<0.001, sHR: 2.02 [1.59-2.57]). Additionally, patients with a history of HE (p<0.001, sHR: 1.59 [1.21-2.07]) and history of HE and early HE post-TIPS (p<0.001, sHR: 3.44 [2.34-5.04]) showed impaired survival. These findings were confirmed in the landmark and multivariable analyses. CONCLUSION: Early HE post-TIPS is associated with significantly reduced survival. Therefore, patients who experience early HE or have a history of HE should be closely monitored by physicians, as they constitute a particularly vulnerable group with impaired survival.",27/09/2024,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal        of the American Gastroenterological Association

Polypharmacy is defined as the regular use of multiple medications, and over the last years has become an emerging aspect of HF care, particularly in older and frailer patients who are more frequently on multiple treatments, and are therefore more likely exposed to tolerability issues, drug-drug interactions and practical difficulties in management. Polypharmacy negatively affects adherence to treatment, and is associated with a higher risk of adverse drug reactions, impaired quality of life, more hospitalizations and worse prognosis. It is important to adopt and implement strategies for the management of polypharmacy from other medical disciplines, including medication reconciliation, therapeutic revision and treatment prioritization. It is also essential to develop new HF-specific strategies, with the primary goal of avoiding the use of redundant treatments, minimizing adverse drug reactions and interactions, and finally improving adherence.

Notably, microglia-specific AD-associated variants preferentially target the MAPK pathway, including recurrent CBL ring-domain mutations. These variants activate ERK and drive a microglia transcriptional program characterized by a strong neuro-inflammatory response, both in vitro and in patients.

However, the mechanisms of PAD2 on macrophage function in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA)-induced acute lung injury syndrome (ALI) remains unclear. Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry-based proteomics, a new citrullination site at arginine 171 (R171) is discovered within nuclear factor- κB (NF-κB) p65 catalyzed by PAD2, which modulates PAD2-NF-κB p65-importin α3 pathway and its downstream M1/M2 macrophage polarization. Building on these findings, a cell-specific targeted therapeutic strategy using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) conjugated with a novel PAD2 inhibitor, AFM41a, and an intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) antibody is developed. This approach enables the selective delivery of the inhibitor to M1-polarized macrophages in the PA-infected alveolar niche.

However, traditional MSC-based therapies are hindered by issues such as microvascular obstruction and low cell survival after transplantation. Exosomes derived from MSCs (MSC-Exo) provide a cell-free, nanoscale alternative, mitigating these risks and offering therapeutic potential for liver diseases. Nonetheless, the functional variability of MSCs from different sources complicates their clinical application. Stem cells derived from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) offer advantages such as ease of procurement and robust proliferative capacity, but their secretome, particularly SHED-Exo, remains underexplored in the context of liver disease therapy. This study analyzed MSC-Exo from various sources via small RNA sequencing to identify differences in microRNA profiles, aiding in the selection of optimal MSC sources for clinical use. SHED-Exo was subsequently tested in an acute liver injury model, showing notable regenerative effects, including enhanced hepatocyte proliferation, macrophage polarization, and reduced inflammation. Despite strong liver-targeting properties, the rapid hepatic clearance of SHED-Exo limits its effectiveness in chronic liver diseases. To address this challenge, a GelMA-based hydrogel was developed for in situ delivery, ensuring sustained release and enhanced antifibrotic efficacy, providing a promising strategy for chronic liver disease management.",15/03/2025,ACS applied materials & interfaces

The cyclic ubiquitination and degradation of several cell cycle regulators are required for endoreplication progression. However, the deubiquitinase that deubiquitinates and stabilizes key factors to modulate endoreplication remains unknown. Here, we found in the endoreplicating Drosophila salivary gland and Bombyx silk gland that the depletion of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 8 (USP8) led to endoreplication arrest and a decrease in gland size. Mechanistically, we showed that USP8 interacted with the Fizzy-related (Fzr) protein, a conserved master regulator of endoreplication, thereby deubiquitinating and stabilizing Fzr to modulate endoreplication. Moreover, the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) mediated proper folding of Fzr and increased the interaction between Fzr and USP8, thereby promoting the deubiquitination and stabilization of Fzr. Together, our study demonstrates that USP8 and Hsp70 regulate endoreplication by synergistically maintaining Fzr stability though deubiquitination.",19/03/2025,Science advances

DESIGN: Prospective, single-arm, multicenter study. SETTING: Adult patients with T2DM enrolled from April 2021 to March 2023 across 9 study sites in India. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary objective was to determine the adverse event (AE) profile of the FDC. Additionally, we assessed changes in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), systolic blood pressure, and body weight at 24 weeks, compared to baseline. RESULTS: Of the 196 patients (median age [range]: 53 [20 to 78] years) analyzed, 61.2% were males with mean ± standard deviation [SD] duration of T2DM of 7.1 ± 5.7 years. Overall, 111 (56.6%) presented with ≥1 comorbidity; the most frequent being hypertension (57; 29.1%). At 24 weeks, a total of 22 patients (11.2%) experienced 40 AEs; the majority of them had mild AEs. The most frequent AEs included urinary tract infection (5; 2.6%), pyrexia (5; 2.6%), nasopharyngitis (3; 1.5%), and balanoposthitis (3; 1.5%). The AEs of special interest reported were genital tract infection (3; 1.5%) and hypoglycemia (1; 0.5%). No serious AEs were reported. None of the AEs required treatment discontinuation.

10.3389/fphar.2025.1486357,Identification of glycolysis-related gene signatures for prognosis and therapeutic targeting in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.,"Gao, Han,Sun, Zhongyi,Hu, Xingxing,Song, Weiwei,Liu, Yuan,Zou, Menglin,Zhu, Minghui,Cheng, Zhenshun","BACKGROUND: Glycolysis plays a crucial role in fibrosis, but the specific genes involved in glycolysis in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are not well understood. METHODS: Three IPF gene expression datasets were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), while glycolysis-related genes were retrieved from the Molecular Signatures Database (MsigDB). Differentially expressed glycolysis-related genes (DEGRGs) were identified using the ""limma"" R package. Diagnostic glycolysis-related genes (GRGs) were selected through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression regression and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE). A prognostic signature was developed using LASSO regression, and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to evaluate predictive performance. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were analyzed to examine GRG expression across various cell types. Immune infiltration analysis, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) were performed to elucidate potential molecular mechanisms. A bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model was used for experimental validation via reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). RESULTS: 14 GRGs (VCAN, MERTK, FBP2, TPBG, SDC1, AURKA, ARTN, PGP, PLOD2, PKLR, PFKM, DEPDC1, AGRN, CXCR4) were identified as diagnostic markers for IPF, with seven (ARTN, AURKA, DEPDC1, FBP2, MERTK, PFKM, SDC1) forming a prognostic model demonstrating predictive power (AUC: 0.831-0.793). scRNA-seq revealed cell-type-specific GRG expression, particularly in macrophages and fibroblasts. Immune infiltration analysis linked GRGs to imbalanced immune responses. Experimental validation in a bleomycin-induced fibrosis model confirmed the upregulation of GRGs (such as AURKA, CXCR4). Drug prediction identified inhibitors (such as Tozasertib for AURKA, Plerixafor for CXCR4) as potential therapeutic agents. CONCLUSION: This study identifies GRGs as potential prognostic biomarkers for IPF and highlights their role in modulating immune responses within the fibrotic lung microenvironment. Notably, AURKA, MERTK, and CXCR4 were associated with pathways linked to fibrosis progression and represent potential therapeutic targets.

While lifestyle interventions are widely recognized as effective for managing obesity in children and adolescents, their effects on mental health remain unclear. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the effects of lifestyle interventions on mental health outcomes among children and adolescents with overweight or obesity. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched five databases (PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, CENTRAL and CINAHL) for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) published from database inception to December 7, 2024, without language restrictions. Lifestyle interventions are defined as structured programs that promote health-related behavioural changes across diverse domains, such as physical activity, dietary adjustments, cognitive training, and psychosocial support. We included studies that assessed the effects of lifestyle interventions on mental health outcomes among children and adolescents with overweight or obesity. Two reviewers independently screened records for eligibility, extracted study-level data and assessed risk of bias of RCTs and NRSIs via the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for randomised controlled trials (RoB 2) and the Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I), and certainty of the evidence by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. RCTs were prioritized as the primary source of evidence, while NRSIs served as supplementary evidence. A random-effects meta-analysis model was performed to calculate pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analyses stratified by age, body mass index (BMI) category, intervention type, theoretical framework, duration, and World Bank income region, were further conducted to identify potential sources of heterogeneity. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO, CRD42024571061. FINDINGS: We identified 20,359 records, of which 26 studies (17 RCTs and nine NRSIs) involving 3511 children and adolescents with overweight or obesity were included. Mental health outcomes assessed included depression, anxiety, self-concept, self-efficacy, negative affect, quality of life, and emotional functioning. Lifestyle interventions evaluated encompassed physical activity, health education, emotion regulation, diet, and multicomponent approaches. Among RCTs, reductions in depression (SMD = -0.24, 95% CI: -0.39 to -0.10, I-square [I (2)] = 0.0%) and improvements in quality of life (SMD = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.04-0.44, I (2) = 44.0%) were observed, with moderate certainty. Subgroup analyses revealed greater reductions in depression among adolescents and participants with obesity, in programs that involving multicomponent approaches, lasting below three months, using behavioural and cognitive theory, or being conducted in high-income countries (HICs). For quality of life, greater improvements were observed among participants with overweight or obesity, in programs based on behavioural and cognitive theory, or in those conducted in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Meanwhile, among NRSIs, reductions in depression (SMD = -0.22, 95% CI: -0.33 to -0.11, I (2) = 11.5%), as well as enhancements in self-concept (SMD = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.09-0.29, I (2) = 0.0%), quality of life (SMD = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.23-0.81, I (2) = 86.2%), and emotional functioning (SMD = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.21-0.60, I (2) = 0.0%) were noted. However, the effects on other mental health outcomes, including anxiety, negative affect, and self-efficacy, remain inconclusive. INTERPRETATION: Lifestyle interventions modestly improve depressive symptoms and quality of life in children and adolescents with overweight or obesity, with additional benefits for self-concept and emotional functioning observed in NRSIs. These findings underscore the potential of lifestyle interventions to address both physical and mental health. Future research should focus on evaluating long-term psychological outcomes and developing cost-effective, culturally tailored interventions.

The primary objective was to assess the biologically effective dose of 5-aza as determined by molecular changes in paired baseline and on-treatment tumor biopsies; the secondary objective was safety.RESULTSThirty-eight percent (3 of 8) of participants with evaluable paired tissue samples had a greater-than 2-fold increase from baseline in IFN-γ signature and CD274 (programmed cell death protein 1 ligand, PD-L1) expression within the tumor microenvironment (TME), which was associated with increased CD8+ T cell infiltration and decreased infiltration of CD4+ T regulatory cells. The mean neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) decreased by greater than 50%, from 14.2 (SD 22.6) to 6.9 (SD 5.2). Median overall survival (OS) was 16.3 months (95% CI 1.9, NA), 2-year OS rate was 24.7% (95% CI: 4.5%, 53.2%), and 58% (7 of 12) of treated participants demonstrated prolonged OS of greater than 12 months.CONCLUSIONOur findings suggest that low-dose 5-aza can reprogram systemic host immune responses and the local TME to increase IFN-γ and PD-L1 expression.

10.1172/JCI188358,Adding insult to injury: the spectrum of tubulointerstitial responses in acute kidney injury.,"Baker, Megan L,Cantley, Lloyd G","Acute kidney injury (AKI) encompasses pathophysiology ranging from glomerular hypofiltration to tubular cell injury and outflow obstruction. This Review will focus on the tubulointerstitial processes that underlie most cases of AKI. Tubular epithelial cell (TEC) injury can occur via distinct insults, including ischemia, nephrotoxins, sepsis, and primary immune-mediated processes. Following these initial insults, tubular cells can activate survival and repair responses or they can develop mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic reprogramming, cell-cycle arrest, and programmed cell death. Developing evidence suggests that the fate of individual tubular cells to survive and proliferate or undergo cell death or senescence is frequently determined by a biphasic immune response with initial proinflammatory macrophage, neutrophil, and lymphocyte infiltration exacerbating injury and activating programmed cell death, while alternatively activated macrophages and specific lymphocyte subsets subsequently modulate inflammation and promote repair. Functional recovery requires that this reparative phase supports proteolytic degradation of tubular casts, proliferation of surviving TECs, and restoration of TEC differentiation. Incomplete resolution or persistence of inflammation can lead to failed tubular repair, fibrosis, and chronic kidney disease. Despite extensive research in animal models, translating preclinical findings to therapies remains challenging, emphasizing the need for integrated multiomic approaches to advance AKI understanding and treatment.",17/03/2025,The Journal of clinical investigation

This study explored the role of Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3 alpha (HNF3α/FOXA1) in renal fibrosis and CKD after IRI. Kidney biopsy specimens from CKD patients and mouse models (IRI or unilateral ureteral obstruction) showed HNF3α upregulation in fibrotic kidneys, linked to renal function decline. Additional experiments demonstrated that deletion of HNF3α mitigated IRI-induced renal fibrosis, and that overexpression of HNF3α led to increased fibrosis. Examination of the potential mechanism by transcriptome sequencing and CUT&Tag sequencing suggested that HNF3α promoted renal fibrosis by increasing the expression of the NCK associated protein 1 like (Nckap1l, formerly known as hematopoietic protein 1 [Hem1]), a vital component of the WAVE complex which plays a significant role in cytoskeletal regulation and cell migration. These results underscore the critical function of HNF3α in renal fibrosis following IRI, and also identify Nckap1l as a potential therapeutic target, thus opening new avenues for research and potential therapeutic interventions for CKD and renal fibrosis.",20/02/2025,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)"

Metformin, as a first-line oral hypoglycemic agent, has garnered widespread research interest in recent years due to its potential in cancer prevention and treatment. However, its efficacy varies significantly across different tumor types. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), such as SAHA, have demonstrated antitumor activity, but TNBC responds poorly to HDACi monotherapy, possibly due to feedback activation of the JAK-STAT pathway. Exploring the synergistic potential and underlying mechanisms of combining metformin with HDACi in TNBC treatment is crucial. METHODS: We predicted the synergistic effects of metformin and SAHA in TNBC using multiple computational methods (CMap, DTsyn, and DrugComb). We also developed a cancer-specific compound mimic library (CDTSL) and applied a three-step strategy to identify genes fitting the ""metformin sensitization"" model. Subsequently, we evaluated the synergistic effects of metformin and SAHA in TNBC cell lines through cell proliferation, colony formation, and apoptosis assays. Furthermore, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of the combined treatment using techniques such as transcriptome sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), Western blotting, and measurement of extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Additionally, we assessed the in vivo antitumor effects of the combined therapy in a nude mouse subcutaneous xenograft model. RESULTS: CMap, DTsyn, and DrugComb all predicted the synergistic effects of SAHA and metformin in TNBC. The screening results revealed that HDAC10 played a key role in metformin sensitization. We found that the combination of metformin and SAHA exhibited synergistic antitumor effects (combination index CI < 0.9) in TNBC cell lines. Mechanistically, metformin inhibited histone acetylation on FGFR4, thereby blocking the feedback activation of FGFR4 downstream pathways induced by SAHA. Furthermore, metformin interfered with the glycolysis process induced by SAHA, altering the metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells. In in vivo experiments, the combined treatment of metformin and SAHA significantly inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumors in nude mice. CONCLUSIONS: Metformin enhances the sensitivity of TNBC to HDAC inhibitors by blocking the FGFR4 pathway and interfering with metabolic reprogramming. When used in combination with SAHA, metformin exhibits synergistic antitumor effects. Our study provides a theoretical basis for the combined application of HDAC inhibitors and metformin, potentially offering a new strategy for the treatment of TNBC.",07/02/2024,Journal of biomedical science

All randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing two or more treatments for postmenopausal osteoporosis supplemented with vitamin D and/or calcium were accessed. Only studies that indicated daily vitamin D and/or calcium supplementation doses were accessed. Data from 37 RCTs (43,397 patients) were retrieved. Patients received a mean of 833.6 ± 224.0 mg and 92.8 ± 228.7 UI of calcium and vitamin D supplementation, respectively. The mean length of the follow-up was 25.8 ± 13.3 months. The mean age of the patients was 66.4 ± 5.6 years, and the mean BMI was 25.2 ± 1.6 kg/m(2). There was evidence of a statistically significant negative association between daily vitamin D supplementation and gastrointestinal adverse events (r = - 0.5; P = 0.02) and mortality (r = - 0.7; P = 0.03). No additional statistically significant associations were evidenced. In postmenopausal women who undergo antiresorptive treatment for osteoporosis, vitamin D was associated with a lower frequency of gastrointestinal adverse events and mortality. Calcium supplementation did not evidence an association with any of the endpoints of interest.Level of evidence Level I, systematic review of RCTs.",19/12/2023,European journal of medical research

GALNT enzymes initiate O-glycosylation in the Golgi; when relocated to the ER, their activity stimulates ECM degradation. Here, we show that in human rheumatoid and osteoarthritic synovial SFs, GALNTs are relocated to the ER. In an RA mouse model, GALNTs relocation occurs shortly before arthritis symptoms and abates as the animal recovers. An ER GALNTs inhibitor prevents cartilage ECM degradation in vitro and expression of this chimeric protein in SFs results in the protection of cartilage. One of the ER targets of GALNTs is the resident protein Calnexin, which is exported to the cell surface of arthritic SFs. Calnexin participates in matrix degradation by reducing ECM disulfide bonds. Anti-Calnexin antibodies block ECM degradation and protect animals from RA. In sum, ER O-glycosylation is a key switch in arthritic SFs and glycosylated surface Calnexin could be a therapeutic target.",11/06/2021,Nature communications
,Occurrence of 14 cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in a closed dairy herd.,"Winter, M H,Aldridge, B M,Scott, P R,Clarke, M","Fourteen cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) were diagnosed on the basis of clinical examination in a closed herd of British Friesian cows during a 9-month period from October 1987 until June 1988. The diagnosis was confirmed on histopathological examination of brain tissue from five of the six samples submitted. The main presenting clinical signs were of altered behaviour: apprehension, anxiety and hyperaesthesia. One cow was euthanized after a short period of recumbency; the remaining 13 cows were slaughtered on humane or economic grounds. No protein of animal origin had been fed to either heifers or cows in this herd during the past 5 years and there had been no direct contact with sheep. The epidemiology of BSE in this report suggests that, if the postulate of Morgan (1988) is correct, infection is ingested within the first 6 months of life and there then follows a 4-5-year period before clinical signs appear.",01/03/1989,The British veterinary journal

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important regulatory roles in the development of atherosclerosis. However, the biological functions and potential molecular mechanisms of circRNAs in HHcy-induced lipid accumulation leading to atherosclerosis are still unclear. In this study, it is determined that homocysteine (Hcy) downregulates the expression of circ-PIAS1-5 by global circRNA expression profiling and that circ-PIAS1-5 inhibits Hcy-mediated lipid accumulation in foam cells and the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by acting as a sponge for miR-219a-2-3p. Circ-PIAS1-5 is identified as a potential diagnostic biomarker of HHcy-associated atherosclerosis in male ""apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE(-/-))"" mice. Mechanistically, circ-PIAS1-5 activates the adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase pathway by regulating TEAD1 through miR-219a-2-3p, and Hcy mediates the m(6)A modification and nuclear export of circ-PIAS1-5 via YTHDC1 to increase lipid accumulation in foam cells and accelerate the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Taken together, these results highlight the role of circ-PIAS1-5 in the Hcy-mediated pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and suggest its potential application as a prognostic biomarker of atherosclerosis induced by HHcy.",26/01/2025,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)"

Antipsychotics are associated with QT interval prolongation, which is a risk factor for arrhythmia and cardiac arrest. The differences between antipsychotic with regard to QT interval prolongation are not well understood. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to compare the QT values associated with different antipsychotics within a real-world population of subjects with clinically stable forms of schizophrenia. METHODS: The FACE-SZ cohort comprises subjects with psychotic disorders, referred to schizophrenia expert cents. QT interval was measured, as well as all treatments (psychotropic and others). The following maintenance treatment for schizophrenia was analysed cross-sectionally: aripiprazole, clozapine, haloperidol, amisulpride, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone. Age, sex, smoking status, body mass index, blood potassium levels, and the co-prescription of another QT-prolonging treatment were used as adjustment factors in multivariable linear regression analyses. RESULTS: Among 792 patients, the mean corrected QT (QTc) interval in the sample of patients under monotherapy was 407 ms. The mean age was 31.7 years, and the majority were male (73.3 %). In comparison to the rest of the sample, clozapine was associated with a longer QTc interval (β = 0.012, 95% CI [0.006-0.018]), while aripiprazole was significantly associated with a shorter QTc interval (β = - 0.010, 95% CI [- 0.016 to - 0.005]). Other antipsychotics were not associated with significant variations of the QTc. CONCLUSIONS: The prescription of antipsychotics should always be accompanied by close monitoring of the QTc interval to prevent the risk of severe cardiac arrhythmia, particularly concerning clozapine.",09/02/2025,Drug safety

In eukaryotes, Arf GTPases initiate this inward budding. Our research shows that Asgard archaea genomes encode putative Arf proteins (AArfs). AArfs possess structural elements characteristic of their eukaryotic counterparts. When expressed in yeast and mammalian cells, some AArfs displayed GTP-dependent membrane targeting. In vitro, AArf associated with both eukaryotic and archaeal membranes. In yeast, AArfs interacted with and were regulated by key organelle biogenesis players. Expressing an AArf led to a massive proliferation of endomembrane organelles including the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. This AArf interacted with Sec23, a COPII vesicle coat component, in a GTP-dependent manner. These findings suggest certain AArfs are membrane-associating molecular switches with the functional potential to initiate organelle biogenesis, and the evolution of a functional coat could be the next critical step towards establishing eukaryotic cell architecture.",26/06/2024,Nature communications

GBM progression is facilitated by the tumor microenvironment (TME), with an immune infiltrate dominated by tumor-associated microglia/macrophages (TAMs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs). The TME is also characterized by hypoxia and the expression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), with HIF-2α emerging as a potential regulator of tumor progression. However, its role in GBM immunosuppression remains unknown. Here, we investigate HIF-2α and the use of the HIF-2α inhibitor PT2385 to modulate the TME in the immunocompetent GL261 mouse GBM model. PT2385 administration in vivo decreased tumor volume and prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice, without affecting GL261 viability in vitro. Notably, HIF-2α inhibition alleviated the immunosuppressive TME and synergized with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) using αPD-1 and αTIM-3 antibodies to promote long-term survival. Comprehensive analysis of the immune infiltrate through single-cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry revealed that combining PT2385 with ICB reduced numbers of pro-tumoral macrophages and Tregs while increasing numbers of microglia, with a corresponding transcriptional modulation towards an anti-tumoral profile of these TAMs. In vitro, deletion of HIF-2α in microglia impeded their polarization towards a pro-tumoral M2-like profile, and its inhibition impaired Treg migration. Our results show that targeting HIF-2α can switch an immunosuppressive TME towards one that favors a robust and sustained response to ICB based immunotherapy. These findings establish that clinically relevant HIF-2α inhibitors should be explored not only in malignancies with defects in the HIF-2α axis, but also in those exhibiting an immunosuppressive TME that limits immunotherapy responsiveness.",16/08/2024,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS

This work seeks to clarify the mechanisms of resistance-related lactylation in OC, intending to offer novel theoretical foundations and therapy strategies for addressing chemoresistance. METHODS: Through the combined analysis of bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq data, we initially found lactylation genes linked to chemoresistance. Subsequently, we employed differential expression analysis, survival analysis, enrichment analysis, and other methodologies to further investigate the roles and molecular mechanisms of these genes in tumor resistance. Ultimately, we investigated the differential expression of these genes in resistant and non-resistant tissues and cells via experimentation. RESULTS: We found two candidate genes associated with lactylation chemoresistance, ALDH1A1 and S100A4. Analysis of single-cell data indicated that tumor cells represent the primary cell subpopulation relevant to resistance studies. Subpopulation analysis indicated that several tumor cell subtypes were markedly linked to resistance, with elevated expression levels of ALDH1A1 and S100A4 in the resistant subpopulation, notably correlating with various immunological and metabolic pathways. Analysis of metabolic pathways indicated that oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis activity was elevated in the resistant subpopulation, and lactic acid buildup was associated with chemoresistance. The investigation of the marker gene protein-protein interaction network in the resistant subgroup elucidated the intricate interactions among these genes. The expression levels of ALDH1A1 and S100A4 in the OC tissues of the platinum-resistant cohort were markedly elevated compared to the sensitive cohort, with a considerable rise in S100A4 expression observed in resistant OC cells, demonstrating co-localization with lactylation. CONCLUSION: This work elucidates the significant function of lactylation in OC chemoresistance and identifies ALDH1A1 and S100A4 as possible genes associated with drug resistance. These findings enhance our comprehension of the mechanisms behind chemoresistance in OC and offer critical insights for the formulation of novel therapeutic options.",19/10/2024,Frontiers in immunology

However, the mechanisms leading to this upregulation and its biological consequences are poorly understood. Here, we identify PRMT5, the main symmetric arginine methyltransferase, as a critical driver of chemoresistance in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). PRMT5 levels and its enzymatic activity are induced in a platinum-resistant (Pt-resistant) state at the protein level. To reveal potential regulators of high PRMT5 protein levels, we optimized intracellular immunostaining conditions and performed unbiased CRISPR screening. We identified Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) as a top-scoring negative regulator of PRMT5. Our mechanistic studies show that KEAP1 directly interacted with PRMT5, leading to its ubiquitin-dependent degradation under normal physiological conditions. At the genomic level, ChIP studies showed that elevated PRMT5 directly interacted with the promoters of stress response genes and positively regulated their transcription. Combined PRMT5 inhibition with Pt resulted in synergistic cellular cytotoxicity in vitro and reduced tumor growth in vivo in Pt-resistant patient-derived xenograft tumors. Overall, the findings from this study identify PRMT5 as a critical therapeutic target in Pt-resistant HGSOC cells and reveal the molecular mechanisms that lead to high PRMT5 levels in Pt-treated and chemo-resistant tumors.",28/06/2024,The Journal of clinical investigation

This study examines the potential relationship between NHHR and both metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and advanced liver fibrosis. METHODS: This study investigated the relationship between NHHR levels and both MASLD and advanced liver fibrosis using data from the 2017-2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in the United States. First, we conducted a baseline characteristics analysis of the population based on NHHR quartiles. Second, we employed multivariable weighted linear regression models to examine the associations between NHHR and MASLD, as well as advanced liver fibrosis. Third, we utilized restricted cubic splines (RCS) to assess potential non-linear relationships. Fourth, we performed subgroup analyses. Finally, ROC curve analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of NHHR. RESULTS: In the main analysis, this study included a total of 9,864 participants. Following multivariable logistic regression and comprehensive adjustments, elevated NHHR levels in the Q3 and Q4 groups were significantly linked to MASLD, with odds ratios of 1.59 (95% CI: 1.20-2.11) and 1.83 (95% CI: 1.40-2.39), respectively (P for trend < 0.0001). Elevated NHHR levels in the Q2 and Q3 groups remained significantly linked to a decreased risk of advanced liver fibrosis, with odds ratios of 0.61 (95% CI 0.40-0.94, P = 0.03) and 0.64 (95% CI 0.47-0.89, P = 0.01), respectively. RCS analysis revealed a U-shaped nonlinear association between NHHR and both MASLD (P = 0.000; P for nonlinear = 0.029) and advanced liver fibrosis (P = 0.0001; P for nonlinear = 0.000). In the subgroup analysis, we found that this relationship was significant only in certain subgroups. The ROC curve analysis revealed that NHHR exhibited the best predictive performance for diagnosing MASLD based on the fatty liver index (FLI). The optimal cutoff point for NHHR in predicting MASLD using FLI was determined to be 2.476, with sensitivity and specificity values of 0.589 and 0.698, respectively. CONCLUSION: NHHR may serve as a predictive marker for MASLD and advanced liver fibrosis, highlighting its potential significance in risk assessment and prevention strategies.",08/10/2024,Frontiers in nutrition

Despite having only weak intrinsic kinase activity, HER3 can contribute to oncogenic signalling via ligand-induced heterodimerization with other HER family members. Evidence indicates that HER3 is altered or aberrantly expressed across a variety of tumour types and can be associated with poor clinical outcomes. Whereas anticancer agents targeting EGFR and HER2 have been approved for decades, no drug targeting HER3 had been approved until very recently. Initial targeting of HER3 with monoclonal antibodies as single agents or in combination with other therapeutics produced disappointing clinical results. Subsequently, efforts have been made to target HER3 with novel agents such as antibody-drug conjugates and bispecific antibodies, with promising efficacy observed in several trials encompassing various tumour types. In December 2024, the HER3 × HER2 bispecific antibody zenocutuzumab was granted FDA Accelerated Approval for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancers or pancreatic cancers harbouring fusions involving NRG1, the gene encoding the high-affinity HER3 ligand neuregulin 1. In this Review, we provide an essential guide to HER3 signalling and oncogenesis, HER3 expression in cancer and its prognostic implications, oncogenic HER3 somatic mutations as well as rare NRG1 fusions that might depend on HER3 signalling, and the roles of HER3 in resistance to cancer therapies.

Tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) have been proven to be important in the reprogramming of tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), but the roles and mechanisms have not been fully clarified. Methods: The roles of HCC-exosome-reprogrammed neutrophils on tumor progression were evaluated in the DEN/CCl(4)-induced HCC mouse model by blocking neutrophil infiltration, depleting neutrophil, and neutrophil adoptive transfer. Transcriptome sequencing and flow cytometry were performed to investigate the effects of HCC exosomes on the phenotype and function of neutrophils. The mobilization and apoptosis of neutrophils were evaluated by the Transwell experiment and Annexin V/7-AAD staining, respectively. Moreover, we detected the effects of HCC-exosome-reprogrammed neutrophils on T cells by flow cytometry. Next, we used the NF-κB pathway inhibitor JSH-23 and miR-362-5p inhibitor or mimic to determine the molecular mechanisms. Lastly, we constructed the miR-362-5p sponge to validate its targeted therapeutic potential. Results: We found that HCC exosomes induced neutrophil infiltration and T-cell exhaustion in the livers of DEN/CCl(4)-induced HCC mice and promoted tumor progression. Blocking neutrophil infiltration and depleting neutrophils diminished these promotive effects of HCC exosomes. In addition, HCC exosome-reprogrammed neutrophils display proinflammatory and protumor phenotypes, and can directly induce T-cell exhaustion in vitro. The transfer of HCC exosome-reprogrammed neutrophils exacerbated tumor progression and induced T-cell exhaustion, as evidenced by the downregulation of IFN-γ and TNF-α, and the upregulation of PD-1 and Tim3 in T cells. Mechanistically, we found that HCC exosomes upregulate the expression of miR-362-5p in neutrophils and activate the NF-κB signaling pathway by targeting CYLD, promoting the survival and recruitment of neutrophils. In HCC mice, blocking miR-362-5p suppressed neutrophil infiltration, attenuated T-cell exhaustion, and suppressed HCC progression. Conclusions: This study clarified the roles of HCC exosomes on neutrophil infiltration and reprogramming and identified a potential target miR-362-5p for HCC treatment.",02/10/2024,Theranostics

Herein, we propose an oxygen vacancy-rich (BiFe)(0.9)(BaTi)(0.1)O(3-)(x) nanoreactor as a piezoelectric sonosensitizer by spatiotemporal ultrasound-driven sono- and chemodynamic tandem catalysis to amplify antibacterial efficacy. The piezoelectric charge carriers under a built-in electric field synchronize the reaction of O(2) and H(2)O, efficiently generating H(2)O(2). The electron-rich oxygen vacancies modulate the local electronic structure of an Fe site. It facilitates reactive oxygen species generation by piezoelectric electrons and accelerates valence state cycles of Fe(III)/Fe(II) to achieve the sustained maintenance of hydroxyl radicals via H(2)O(2)/Fe(II)-catalyzed chemodynamic reactions, which lead to bacterial membrane damage. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that intracellular Fe overload induced by excessive Fe(II)-mediated dysregulation of the two-component system disrupts bacterial metabolism, triggering bacterial ferroptosis-like death.

MIS-C is characterized by a specific T cell expansion(2) and systemic hyperinflammation(3). The pathogenesis of MIS-C remains largely unknown. Here we show that acute MIS-C is characterized by impaired reactivation of virus-reactive memory T cells, which depends on increased serum levels of the cytokine TGFβ resembling those that occur during severe COVID-19 (refs. (4,5)). This functional impairment in T cell reactivity is accompanied by the presence of TGFβ-response signatures in T cells, B cells and monocytes along with reduced antigen-presentation capabilities of monocytes, and can be reversed by blocking TGFβ. Furthermore, T cell receptor repertoires of patients with MIS-C exhibit expansion of T cells expressing TCRVβ21.3, resembling Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-reactive T cell clones capable of eliminating EBV-infected B cells. Additionally, serum TGFβ in patients with MIS-C can trigger EBV reactivation, which is reversible with TGFβ blockade. Clinically, the TGFβ-induced defect in T cell reactivity correlates with a higher EBV seroprevalence in patients with MIS-C compared with age-matched controls, along with the occurrence of EBV reactivation. Our findings establish a connection between SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 sequelae in children, in which impaired T cell cytotoxicity triggered by TGFβ overproduction leads to EBV reactivation and subsequent hyperinflammation.",04/07/2023,Nature

However, reconstituting mtDNA deletions linked to mitochondrial myopathies remains challenging. Here, we engineered mtDNA deletions in human cells by co-expressing end-joining (EJ) machinery and targeted endonucleases. Using mitochondrial EJ (mito-EJ) and mito-ScaI, we generated a panel of clonal cell lines harboring a ∼3.5 kb mtDNA deletion across the full spectrum of heteroplasmy. Investigating these cells revealed a critical threshold of ∼75% deleted genomes, beyond which oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) protein depletion, metabolic disruption, and impaired growth in galactose-containing media were observed. Single-cell multiomic profiling identified two distinct nuclear gene deregulation responses: one triggered at the deletion threshold and another progressively responding to heteroplasmy. Ultimately, we show that our method enables the modeling of disease-associated mtDNA deletions across cell types and could inform the development of targeted therapies.",27/08/2024,Cell

Rats were administered sodium chloride, L-Gln, GS, or CXB via gavage for eight weeks starting from the fifth week after sham operation or Anterior Cruciate Ligament Transection (ACLT) + Medial Meniscectomy (MMx). Then the severity of knee OA in rats was evaluated by serological analysis, histological examination and imaging examination. In addition, patients with mild primary OA were administered L-Gln, GS, or CXB orally for 12 weeks in accordance with the randomization principle. The efficacy end points were the change from baseline to week 24 in the pain and physical function subscale scores of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities OA Index (WOMAC), and Lequesne score. Treatment with L-Gln alleviated the increased concentration of serum cartilage degradation markers caused by OA in rats. Histological tests showed improvement in knee joint cartilage destruction after treatment. Three-dimensional CT scans and reconstructions revealed a reduction in osteophyte formation and subchondral bone loss. L-glutamine performed as well as or better than glucosamine sulfate and celecoxib in all comparative measures among the three treatment groups. In clinical trials, the WOMAC pain and physical function subscale scores, as well as the Lequesne score, decreased from baseline in all three patient groups during follow-up, with no significant differences observed between the groups. Our research indicates that L-Gln is comparable to GS and CXB in improving the pathological progression and clinical efficacy of OA, which makes it a promising drug for the treatment of osteoarthritis.",07/11/2024,Scientific reports

They struggle to recognise and assert their own identity over the illness's identity and relate to it from a powerless and subordinate position. AVATAR therapy was developed to help patients with psychosis to gain greater power and control over distressing voices. The goal of this study was to test the feasibility, acceptability, safety and preliminary efficacy of an adaptation of AVATAR therapy for anorexia nervosa. METHODS: Twelve adult patients with anorexia nervosa were recruited. Ten completed an assessment session and between five to seven therapy sessions. The assessment session consisted in the creation of an avatar to represent the ""eating disorder"". This was accomplished by manipulating auditory and visual characteristics through a specialist computer software. During the therapy sessions, patients interacted with the avatar to assert their own desires and will. Patients completed baseline, end of intervention and follow-up (4-week) online questionnaires. A non-concurrent multiple baselines single case experimental design (SCED) was used (A(1)BA(2)). Feasibility, acceptability, safety and preliminary efficacy of the intervention were assessed. RESULTS: The therapy met pre-specified criteria relating to (1) Feasibility: sample recruited within three months; retention rate at the end of the treatment phase = 81.9%; therapy completion rate = 90.1%. (2) Safety: no serious adverse events associated with the intervention. (3) Acceptability: mean ratings = 7.5 (SD = 2.61) out of ten, on a 0-10 scale of acceptability (10 = complete satisfaction). With regards to efficacy, participants reported significantly lower levels of distress associated with the eating disorder voice and higher levels of self-compassion at the end of treatment. No other significant changes were observed in frequency of the eating disorder voice, voice's characteristics, such as omnipotence and malevolence, eating disorder symptoms and symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress. Patients' feedback indicated that the therapy had helped with their ability to stand up to the illness, make positive changes around eating, and increase their motivation to recover and self-compassion. CONCLUSION: AVATAR therapy for anorexia nervosa is feasible, acceptable and safe for patients. Larger studies are needed to test clinical efficacy.

Targeting the PD-1/PDL-1 axis is currently the only FDA approved immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment for HNSCC. Novel therapies targeting other pathways are needed along with testing a combinational approach to find new and more efficient ways to treat this disease. We utilized a tamoxifen inducible TgfβR1/Pten deletion mouse model to explore the efficacy of combined anti-LAG-3 and anti-PD-1 therapy against tongue HNSCC and determine underlying immunological mechanisms. Combined anti-LAG-3/anti-PD-1 therapy was effective at decreasing the tumor burden and lymphatic metastasis compared to anti-LAG-3 treatment but not when compared to the anti-PD-1 treatment alone. Anti-tumoral effects of anti-PD1 and anti-LAG-3/anti-PD-1 combined therapy were associated with increased CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell proliferative responses in secondary lymphoid organs along with increased CD8+ T-cell tumor infiltration. Anti-LAG-3 treatment potentiated the anti-tumoral properties of CD4+ T-cells treated with anti-PD-1, including enhanced systemic IFN-γ production and TNF-α production in the tumor microenvironment. Further, anti-tumoral cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell effector function and granzyme B production were enhanced by anti-PD-1 and combinatorial anti-LAG-3/anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, resulting in greater tumor cell death. Our results demonstrate that anti-LAG-3 has the potential to enhance the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy; however, humanized mouse models that better recapitulate the human disease with FDA approved antibodies are needed to further characterize the efficacy of this treatment as a viable treatment option for HNSCC patients.",18/03/2025,Oncoimmunology

As the predominant etiology of dementia, AD affects millions of individuals worldwide, with its hallmark pathological feature being the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, which disrupt neuronal function and progressively compromise brain structure. Early clinical manifestations often include forgetfulness, disorientation, and social withdrawal. Primarily impacting the elderly population, AD significantly impairs daily functioning and diminishes overall quality of life. Current therapeutic approaches for AD mainly focus on symptomatic relief and decelerating the disease's progression. Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil and rivastigmine, increase acetylcholine (ACh) levels to enhance cognitive function in individuals with mild to moderate AD. For individuals in more advanced stages of the disease, NMDA receptor antagonists modulate glutamate activity to mitigate excitotoxicity. In addition to pharmacological interventions, lifestyle modifications such as adherence to a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and cognitive engagement are advocated to support brain health. Novel therapeutic avenues are being explored to address underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, such as metal ion dysregulation within the brain. Furthermore, non-pharmacological approaches, including cognitive-behavioral therapy and patient support groups, provide essential behavioral and emotional support. Cutting-edge research continues to investigate innovative treatments, such as immunotherapies targeting amyloid plaques and tau tangles and neuroprotective compounds derived from natural sources. The goal of these multifaceted strategies is to alleviate symptoms, enhance quality of life, and offer hope for individuals and families affected by AD.

Growing studies have investigated the intricate microvascular and neural circuitry within the retina, its interactions with other systemic vascular and nervous systems, and the link between retinal biomarkers and various systemic diseases. Using the eye to study systemic health, based on these connections, has been given a term as oculomics. Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly deep learning, have further increased the potential impact of this study. Leveraging these technologies, retinal analysis has demonstrated potentials in detecting numerous diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, central nervous system diseases, chronic kidney diseases, metabolic diseases, endocrine disorders, and hepatobiliary diseases. AI-based retinal imaging, which incorporates established modalities such as digital color fundus photographs, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography, as well as emerging technologies like ultra-wide field imaging, shows great promises in predicting systemic diseases. This provides a valuable opportunity for systemic diseases screening, early detection, prediction, risk stratification, and personalized prognostication. As the AI and big data research field grows, with the mission of transforming healthcare, they also face numerous challenges and limitations both in data and technology. The application of natural language processing framework, large language model, and other generative AI techniques presents both opportunities and concerns that require careful consideration.

The programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) blockade camrelizumab has demonstrated considerable value in recurrent or metastatic NPC, while its role in locoregionally advanced NPC is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant camrelizumab for patients with locoregionally advanced NPC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial conducted from August 2018 to November 2021 at 11 centers in China and enrolling 450 patients with T4N1M0 or T1-4N2-3M0 NPC who had completed induction-concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The final date of follow-up was March 20, 2024. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive adjuvant camrelizumab (200 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks for 12 cycles; n = 226) or observation (standard therapy group; n = 224). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was event-free survival (freedom from distant metastasis, locoregional relapse, or death due to any cause). Secondary end points included distant metastasis-free survival, locoregional relapse-free survival, overall survival, safety, and health-related quality of life. RESULTS: Among the 450 participants (mean age, 45 [SD, 10] years; 24% women), after a median follow-up of 39 (IQR, 33-50) months, the camrelizumab group had a 3-year event-free survival rate of 86.9%, whereas the standard therapy group had a rate of 77.3% (stratified hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.36-0.89; P = .01). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported in 23 patients (11.2%) in the camrelizumab and 7 (3.2%) in the standard therapy group. Reactive capillary endothelial proliferation was the most common adverse event related to camrelizumab, occurring in 85.8% of patients at grade 1 or 2, while 2% of patients had grade 3 or 4 events. There was no significant deterioration in quality of life associated with camrelizumab treatment.

The dynamics of tubulin are crucial in maintaining ocular homeostasis, closely linked to cellular proliferation and angiogenesis. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms driving this process is vital for formulating effective therapeutic strategies. Methods: Multiple transcriptome analyses revealed upregulation of endothelial tubulin beta-6 chain (Tubb6) in oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) and laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) mice models. Transwell migration assay, wound healing assay, tube formation assay, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescent staining were employed to identify the role of TUBB6 knockout (KO) in vitro. The effects of Tubb6 silencing on retinal angiogenesis and choroidal neovascularization were subsequently evaluated. Results: We identified upregulated Tubb6 expression in retinas from OIR mice through combination analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and bulk RNA-Seq. The RNA expression profiles of endothelial cells (ECs) from proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) patients and neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) patients also exhibited an elevation in TUBB6. Notably, Tubb6 was abundantly expressed in ECs and pericytes, and was predominantly localized to proliferative ECs and vascular tip cells. Functional studies demonstrated that TUBB6 knockdown reduced the expression of proliferative and tip cell markers in vitro. Tubb6 deficiency decreased vascular sprouting and tip cell formation of OIR mice retina and retarded CNV progression in vivo. Mechanistically, YBX1, an RNA-binding protein, was identified as an upstream regulator of TUBB6 via binding to its 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) and maintaining mRNA stability. Transcriptome analysis further linked TUBB6 to the activity of WNT pathway. TUBB6 silencing suppressed the WNT signaling pathway, with WNT3A and FZD8 identified as downstream targets. Conclusions: Collectively, our research shed light on the pivotal function of TUBB6 in maintaining ocular homeostasis and uncovered the YBX1-TUBB6-WNT3A/FZD8 pathway's involvement in sprouting angiogenesis. Targeting TUBB6 and developing its specific inhibitor could pioneer new approaches for treating ocular microvascular diseases.",02/10/2024,Theranostics

This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of combination therapies for first/second-relapse MM patients from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate three combination therapy groups based on primary drugs (bortezomib, lenalidomide, and carfilzomib). The economic evaluation was conducted within each group individually, rather than across different groups. Clinical inputs for the model were derived from RCT reports, while healthcare costs were sourced from the Zhejiang Province bidding database and a retrospective analysis. Utility values were obtained through an on-site survey using the Chinese version of the EuroQoL Five-dimensional Five-level Questionnaire. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the base-case results. RESULTS: In the bortezomib group, bortezomib-dexamethasone (Vd) yielded 2.42 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at a cost of ¥783,775. With a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of three times the 2023 per capita GDP in China (¥258,074), pomalidomide-bortezomib-dexamethasone was the most cost-effective therapy (¥86,129/QALY) in this group. In the lenalidomide group, lenalidomide-dexamethasone (Rd) resulted in 3.06 QALYs at a cost of ¥840,509. Compared to Rd, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of elotuzumab-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (¥5,095,300/QALY), ixazomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (¥1,605,712/QALY), carfilzomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (¥955,255/QALY), and daratumumab-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (¥851,933/QALY) all exceeded the WTP threshold. In the carfilzomib group, carfilzomib-dexamethasone (Kd) resulted in 3.19 QALYs at a cost of ¥1,961,624. Compared to Kd, the ICERs of daratumumab-carfilzomib-dexamethasone (¥2,250,821/QALY) and isatuximab-carfilzomib-dexamethasone (¥4,977,964/QALY) also exceeded the WTP.

Consequently, employing human samples-such as whole blood or fractions, valvular and vascular tissues, myocardium, pericardium, or human-derived cells-is essential for enhancing the translational relevance of cardiovascular research. For instance, myocardial tissue slices, which preserve crucial structural and functional characteristics of the human heart, can be used in vitro to examine drug responses. Human blood serves as a rich source of biomarkers, including extracellular vesicles, various types of RNA (miRNA, lncRNA, and circRNAs), circulating inflammatory cells, and endothelial colony-forming cells, facilitating detailed studies of cardiovascular diseases. Primary cardiomyocytes and vascular cells isolated from human tissues are invaluable for mechanistic investigations in vitro. In cases where these are unavailable, human induced pluripotent stem cells serve as effective substitutes, albeit with specific limitations.

We investigated associations of HLA variants, amino acid polymorphisms, zygosity, and evolutionary divergence (HED) with HBV-related HCC in Han Chinese and explored biological mechanisms. APPROACH RESULTS: We examined the associations of HLA variants (imputed 4-digit classical alleles and amino acid polymorphisms), zygosity, and HED with HBV-related HCC in a discovery set (706 HBV-related HCC cases, 6,197 chronic HBV carriers in Taiwan). Significant signals were validated in independent set (636 cases, 560 controls in Qidong, PR China). We used logistic regression adjusted for sex, age, and top 10 genetic principal components, with a Bonferroni-correction for multiple testing (p<1.6×10-4). We evaluated predicted peptide-binding affinities and control of viral load, viral population diversity, and inflammatory markers for significant signals. HLA-DQB1*03:01 was most significantly associated with HBV-related HCC in discovery and validation sets (ORmeta-analysis=1.33, Pmeta-analysis=2.6×10-8). Three amino acids within DQβ1 peptide-binding region, HLA-DQβ1Ala13, HLA-DQβ1Tyr26, and HLA-DQβ1Glu45, were positively associated with HCC. HLA-DQB1*03:01 was associated with lower binding affinity of HBV nucleocapsid antigen and higher HBV DNA load and serum soluble programmed cell death 1 (sPD-1) (P<0.05). HLA-DQB1 heterozygosity was inversely associated with HCC independent of HLA-DQB1*03:01 (Pmeta-analysis=3.3×10-3). CONCLUSIONS: HLA-DQB1*03:01 and its three key amino acids are associated with an increased HBV-related HCC risk. This association may be explained by the low binding affinity to HBV antigen, resulting in poor control of viral load and increased inflammation, as evidenced by sPD-1 levels.",24/12/2024,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)"

The cuproptosis suppression has been characterized in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME). Here we reveal that hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a driver of cuproptosis resistance in solid tumor. We found that HIF-1α activates pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 and 3 (PDK1/3), resulting in decreased expression of dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase (DLAT) (target of copper), and promotes the accumulation of metallothionein, which sequesters mitochondrial copper, leading to resistance to cuproptosis under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, we discovered that high levels of copper reduce ubiquitination and increase the stability of HIF-1α protein without affecting its mRNA levels. Inhibition of HIF-1α increases the susceptibility of cancer to cuproptosis in vivo. This study unveils the multifaceted role of HIF-1α in cuproptosis and demonstrates the molecular mechanism of hypoxia-promoted carcinogenesis.",23/01/2024,Cancer cell

This review summarizes key developments in imaging modalities, computational tools, and clinical applications, highlighting major breakthroughs in thoracic diseases-lung cancer, pulmonary nodules, interstitial lung disease (ILD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), COVID-19 pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism-and outlining future directions.Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven computer-aided detection systems and radiomic analyses have notably improved the detection and classification of pulmonary nodules, while photon-counting detector CT (PCD-CT) and low-field MRI offer enhanced resolution or radiation-free strategies. For lung cancer, CT texture analysis and perfusion imaging refine prognostication and therapy planning. ILD assessment benefits from automated diagnostic tools and innovative imaging techniques, such as PCD-CT and functional MRI, which reduce the need for invasive diagnostic procedures while improving accuracy. In COPD, dual-energy CT-based ventilation/perfusion assessment and dark-field radiography enable earlier detection and staging of emphysema, complemented by deep learning approaches for improved quantification. COVID-19 research has underscored the clinical utility of chest CT, radiographs, and AI-based algorithms for rapid triage, disease severity evaluation, and follow-up. Furthermore, tuberculosis remains a significant global health concern, highlighting the importance of AI-assisted chest radiography for early detection and management. Meanwhile, advances in CT pulmonary angiography, including dual-energy reconstructions, allow more sensitive detection of pulmonary emboli.Collectively, these innovations demonstrate the power of merging novel imaging technologies, quantitative functional analysis, and AI-driven tools to transform thoracic disease management. Ongoing progress promises more precise and personalized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for diverse thoracic diseases.",19/03/2025,Investigative radiology
10.3389/fimmu.2025.1490491,CD19 -targeted CAR T therapy treating hematologic malignancies: hidden danger is the next neighbor to security?,"Ye, Xueshuai,Ge, Min,Tan, Mengtian,Wu, Yongqiang,Zhang, Haiqiang,Fu, Zexian","CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has achieved marvelous results in the treatment of patients with relapsed and/or refractory B-cell lymphomas, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and multiple myeloma. As a new treatment method that has changed the existing treatment paradigm, there has been a short time from its emergence to FDA approval. However, with the increasing number of cases and the passage of time, hidden problems have gradually been exposed. In this review, we summarize the short- and long-term toxicity, such as secondary T-cell tumors and lethal CAR tumors, of patients with hematologic malignancies treated with CD19-CAR-T cells, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), ICANS, and secondary malignancies with low occurrence rates but high mortality, such as secondary T cell tumors and lethal CAR tumors, which may be related to the gene modification mechanism of viral vectors currently approved for CAR-T cells. We also discuss potential investigational strategies designed to improve the safety of CAR-T-cell therapy.",03/09/2024,Frontiers in immunology
10.3389/fimmu.2025.1515838,Prognostic analysis and identification of M7G immune-related genes in lung squamous cell carcinoma.,"Wenhui, Li,Nan, Wu,Jiayi, Han,Ye, Xu,Chunyu, He,Zhongzhou, Li,Hongtao, Lei,Hui, Tian","BACKGROUND: In recent years, the clinical application of targeted therapies and immunotherapy has significantly improved survival outcomes for patients with lung adenocarcinomas(LUAD). However, due to fewer mutations, lung squamous cell carcinomas(LUSC) shows limited efficacy with targeted and immunotherapy, resulting in a notably lower 5-year survival rate compared to lung adenocarcinoma. The m7G modification plays an important role in tumorigenesis, progression, immune evasion, and therapeutic response. This study aims to develop a novel scoring system based on m7G modification and immune status to clinically predict the prognosis of patients with LUSC and to provide new therapeutic targets. METHODS: In this study, we utilized RNA-seq data from the TCGA-LUSC database as the training set and GSE50081 from the GEO database as the validation set. Immunotherapy data were obtained from the IMMPORT database, and m7G data from previous research. Using bioinformatics, we developed a prognostic model for LUSC based on m7G pathway-related immune gene characteristics. We analyzed the correlation between the prognostic model and clinical pathological features of LUSC, as well as the model's independent prognostic capability. Subsequently, patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups, and we examined the differences in enriched pathways, immune cell infiltration correlations, and drug sensitivity between the two groups. RESULTS: The m7G immune-related genes FGA, CSF3R, and ORM1 increase the survival risk in patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma, whereas NTS exerts a protective effect. The prognostic risk model for lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) based on m7G immune-related gene expression demonstrates that the overall survival of the high-risk group is significantly poorer than that of the low-risk group. CONCLUSION: The risk model developed based on m7G immune-related genes can help predict the clinical prognosis of LUSC patients and guide treatment decisions.",23/10/2024,Frontiers in immunology

Mitochondrial transplantation serves as a promising clinical therapy. However, its widespread application is hindered by the limited availability of healthy mitochondria, with the dose required reaching up to 10(9) mitochondria per injection/patient. This necessitates sustainable and tractable approaches for producing high-quality human mitochondria. In this study, we demonstrated a highly efficient mitochondria-producing strategy by manipulating mitobiogenesis and tuning organelle balance in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Utilizing an optimized culture medium (mito-condition) developed from our established formula, we achieved an 854-fold increase in mitochondria production compared to normal MSC culture within 15 days. These mitochondria were not only significantly expanded but also exhibited superior function both before and after isolation, with ATP production levels reaching 5.71 times that of normal mitochondria. Mechanistically, we revealed activation of the AMPK pathway and the establishment of a novel cellular state ideal for mitochondrial fabrication, characterized by enhanced proliferation and mitobiogenesis while suppressing other energy-consuming activities. Furthermore, the in vivo function of these mitochondria was validated in the mitotherapy in a mouse osteoarthritis model, resulting in significant cartilage regeneration over a 12-week period. Overall, this study presented a new strategy for the off-the-shelf fabrication of human mitochondria and provided insights into the molecular mechanisms governing organelle synthesis.",30/04/2024,Bone research
10.1007/s00018-025-05616-w,Loss of Cep135 causes oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and male infertility in mice.,"Liu, Hui,Zhang, Haozheng,Qin, Guanghao,Song, Tingting,Liu, Xin,Wen, Zongzhuang,Liu, Min,Wang, Xianmei,Fu, Xiaolong,Gao, Jiangang","Centrosomal proteins (Cep), as crucial scaffolding molecules, play a pivotal role in the biogenesis of centrioles and the regulation of the cell cycle. To date, mutation in Cep135 has been reported to be closely associated with multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF) in humans. However, the specific mechanism of Cep135 in spermatogenesis and its detailed role in male infertility remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present compelling evidence that Cep135 functions as a pathogenic gene responsible for oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT) and male infertility in mice. By selectively deleting Cep135 in premeiotic germ cells using Stra8-Cre mice crossed with Cep135(flox/flox) mice, we observed that Cep135 knockdown produced abnormal sperm morphology, germ cell apoptosis and consequentlybecame complete infertility, but did not impact premeiosis. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed defects in acrosome, flagellum, and head-to-tail connections during spermatogenesis. Proteomic analysis further indicated that CEP135 deletion led to a significant reduction in proteins mainly associated with acrosome formation, sperm heads, sperm flagellum and microtubule assembly. Additionally, CEP135 interacts with spermatogenic proteins SPATA6 and AKAP3, regulating their expression and stability. Deficiency in CEP135 or its interacting proteins resulted in ciliary shortening. In conclusion, our study profoundly unveils the central role of Cep135 in spermatogenesis and male fertility. This discovery not only deepens our comprehension of spermatogenesis but also furnishes a solid theoretical foundation and experimental evidence that can guide the formulation of therapeutic and preventive strategies for male infertility.",21/10/2024,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS
10.1172/JCI186889,Cellular and molecular features of asthma mucus plugs provide clues about their formation and persistence.,"Liegeois, Maude A,Hsieh, Aileen,Al-Fouadi, May,Charbit, Annabelle R,Yang, Chen Xi,Hackett, Tillie-Louise,Fahy, John V","BACKGROUNDMucus plugs form in acute asthma and persist in chronic disease. Although eosinophils are implicated in mechanisms of mucus pathology, many mechanistic details about mucus plug formation and persistence in asthma are unknown.METHODSUsing histology and spatial, single-cell proteomics, we characterized mucus-plugged airways from nontransplantable donor lungs of 14 patients with asthma (9 with fatal asthma and 5 with nonfatal asthma) and individuals acting as controls (10 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 14 free of lung disease). Additionally, we used an airway epithelial cell-eosinophil (AEC-eosinophil) coculture model to explore how AEC mucus affects eosinophil degranulation.RESULTSAsthma mucus plugs were tethered to airways showing infiltration with innate lymphoid type 2 cells and hyperplasia of smooth muscle cells and MUC5AC-expressing goblet cells. Asthma mucus plugs were infiltrated with immune cells that were mostly dual positive for eosinophil peroxidase (EPX) and neutrophil elastase, suggesting that neutrophils internalize EPX from degranulating eosinophils. Indeed, eosinophils exposed to mucus from IL-13-activated AECs underwent CD11b- and glycan-dependent cytolytic degranulation. Dual-positive granulocytes varied in frequency in mucus plugs. Whereas paucigranulocytic plugs were MUC5AC rich, granulocytic plugs had a mix of MUC5AC, MUC5B, and extracellular DNA traps. Paucigranulocytic plugs occurred more frequently in (acute) fatal asthma and granulocytic plugs predominated in (chronic) nonfatal asthma.CONCLUSIONTogether, our data suggest that mucin-rich mucus plugs in fatal asthma form because of acute goblet cell degranulation in remodeled airways and that granulocytic mucus plugs in chronic asthma persist because of a sustaining niche characterized by epithelial cell-mucin-granulocyte cross-talk.FUNDINGNIH grants HL080414, HL107202, and AI077439.",10/09/2024,The Journal of clinical investigation

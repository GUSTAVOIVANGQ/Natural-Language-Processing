### Final project
## Introduction
#	NLP helps to solve many problems related to human-computer
communication
#      During the course weihave reviewed some of the most relevant language models such as LLMs and explained their potential
techniques and tasks n NLP
In  recent   weeks  we use today have  discussed  the  topic  of  neural networks in class, including LLMs, to implement a solution to a specific
The aim of the final projects to integrate the techniques seen
task related to NLP technologies
Specifications


#	Form a team of 3 to 4 people

#	The team must propose a solution to the following task:

–   Information retrieval

–   Text classification

–   Sentiment analysis

–   Other NLP related task
Requirements 
#	For the solutions to be valid they must:
–	Use some of the NLP techniques reviewed in class –	It must use LLMs
–	It is necessary to use metrics to evaluate the performance of the methods

–	The use of Spanish corpus is mandatory

–	A user interface to interact with the implemented solution is also recommended (but not mandatory)
Methodology


#	The following methodology is mandatory for the implementation of the project:

1)	Project definition

2)	Corpus selection

3)	Selection of frameworks, libraries or technologies used

4)	Specification of normalization steps

5)	Specification of text representation

6)	Selection of machine learning/deep learning/LLMs methods

7)	Definition of evaluation metrics

8)	Definition of a baseline to compare model performance
Evidence


#   The  following  evidence  must  be  uploaded  to TEAMS platform:

–	Source code
–	Resources like corpus, lexicons, datasets, etc. 
–	Report of the project development

## Report specifications
#	The report must contain the following sections:

–	Introduction. Problem description, relevance of the task, possible applications and proposed solution
–	Corpus and datasets. Corpus and datasets used for the task, specifying:
•	Size, content description, tagged classes (when used)
–	Additional resources. Description of all the resources used as lexicons, pretrained LLMs, etc.
–	Solution. Description of the solution specifying:
•	Text preprocessing
